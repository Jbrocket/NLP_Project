Someone needs to open a GameStop across the ny stock exchange 💎🙌
Bro wtf
This is the hype we need for next week
WE LIKE THE STOCK
This is easily one of the greatest things to happen during our lives
Just when you think this sub can't be any dumber we buy Times Square billboards flexing our idiocy
Edit: Hey guys, it’s a compliment
This just gets better and better
APES TOGETHER STRONG
Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you
Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your GME shares
I LIKE THE STOCK
This is not financial advice
What a legend
I don't belong here really, I am a 63 year old Grandma who knows really nothing about the market
Can't stop won't stop
Not enough 🚀
This is great
Help GME beat earnings for Q4 by buying something from GAMESTOP
WOW
I never thought a revolution could allow me to participate drinking wine in my pajamas and not get hurt by bullets and tear gas
We are human-ing SO HARD right now
LEGENDARY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
STONKS ONLY GO UP 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
We’ve gone mainstream baby
I couldnt partake in the greatness with a kid on the way
How many chicken tendies did that run you
Bought two billboards in LA
EDIT3: DIAMOND HANDS TO THE MOON WITH ROCKET EMOJIS WORKS if you buy billboards make sure to chat u/someguyindeutschland with proof to get listed in the Times Square post
You guys are INSANE - website traffic is blowing up right now so if it doesn't work, use this link: [https://portal
As a Marine , I bend the knee and thank you for your service
I think a lot of hedgefund managers and financial institutions are fuming mad
I got in 8 days ago, money is tight right now, and I YOLO’ed in with $1,000 which is a lot for me
To me, this is more than $GME
WE LIKE THE STOCK
THE REVOLUTION WILL BE ADVERTISED✋💎🚀👨‍🚀🚀🚀💎✋💎✋💎✋
Still waiting for Papa Elon Musk to label his rockets
This is great
Do you think we can get a Superbowl ad next week
Well
You have the support of the Norwegian people, stock trading platforms in Norway was overwhelmed by all the GME buys from Norwegians
The Age of Boomers is ending
You guys are building up some crazy momentum sticking it to the man
Even if we hit 4 digits, HOLD 💎👐🏼
POWER TO THE TRADERS
Incredible
Guys I am thinking of putting about $35K CAD into GME right now
Please post any donations / good will gestures to r/wallstreetgivesback
POV: you sorted comments by new to see the last comments before the lock
This post was flaired as a YOLO so it's on the YOLO list
I like the stonx and milkshakes
Tyler Durden inspires us all to this day
First rule of ape club, u dont talk about sell
Imagine having lost billions of dollars and you have to see this on your way to the unemployment office
Welp, they reopened comments and I cannot remember if I already commented on this post or not, so
I was here
Reddit Recap LESS GOOO
What does it say
FYI this actually isn't in times Square, it's a few blocks south of Central Park
Are my upvotes disappearing
HOLD
MOST UPVOTED REDDIT POST EVER
WE STILL LIKE THE STOCK 💎🙌
Costs $18 an hour
This
Might be $1800/hr and only that cheap because traffic is way down
Y’all are forgetting there’s not much happening in Times Square these days
Yeah that can’t be the price alone
Only $18/hr
Ohh how badly I want to contribute
Extremely Volatility you piece crap the markets have been volatile from day 1 of the pandemic it’s ok for the average joe to go broke but god forbid a greedy billionaire goes broke all hell breaks loose put The CEO of all those who restrict trading from short squeezes or any freaking stock in jail
Total retard here
Still here Apes
The next few episodes of south park are going to be hilarious
I live in NY, can confirm
Are we still buying $GME
Full Support from the European 🦧 buy more GME AMC tomorrow 🙌💎
Top upvoted post of the year
Man, difficult to believe that this was a simpler time
This was in my recap
Him legend
Honestly if they have to liquidate to cover the market will crash
Market rotation into $GME
It's the year 2042
I already liquidated all my mutual funds in my roth a few days ago
APES STRONG TOGETHEUR
I bought up GME with my IRA
Bought it in my HSA
Absolutely YES
The risk/reward is simply not worth it for traditional investing right now, imo
I have been debating shorting some S&P 500 as they might go down if hedge funds liquidate some holdings to pay the interest on the short positions
VXX is the way to play market volatility
Yo most upvoted post of the year 🙌🤙
I love you guys
I like the stonk, and I like how it's on the billboard
A+
Best use of money ever
Wow
This is rad
WE LIKE THE STOCK
You should do it somewhere on Park Ave/5th Ave, as that’s where ALL THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE
Bought GME at 350 and AMC at 14
Can we please kill Nestle next
Now this is coming from someone who doesnt have the means to invest in this movement
Please, only invest in what you are willing to loose
Allow those who have the means to make this work without losing their livelihood make their stand
This WILL work, but dont kill yourself in the process
If people are wondering if its too late to join GME, just tell them $320 IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
GME 🚀🚀🚀 AMC
We should all pool together to buy a 30 second super bowl commerical
Amc all the way folks
I never would have imagine a WSB post could reach top post of all time but here we are you beautiful retards
Wtf you’re the second top post on r/all
This is the second most upvoted post on all of Reddit
You’re not last anymore lol u/flapjack626
I WAS HERE

What is “Brrr”
Brr is the sound a money printing machine makes
Thank you
Check u/pidgeonlover comment history, he said it himself
This one looks like it's "off" times square (in one of the side areas, when I was living there I'd guess a couple blocks away I'd say), certainly not [one of these](https://www
Even the most expensive one (the NYE ball drop one) is only [$1-4 million a YEAR](https://www
That’s 13,000 dollars a month
Check u/pidgeonlover comment history, he said it himself
Yeah, that's true
Last I saw was that mayor and his wife dancing on New Year’s Eve while we all were on lock down
I read earlier in the pandemic that the cost of advertising in Times Square dropped significantly because there was no people there, so I think it's believable
He’s not renting the whole hour
Sure he did
Questionable comments in WSB
It's not Times Square
No idea, guy who bought it said it’s $18/hr and dirt cheap
Probably meant 1,800 or 18,000
Can barely pay a guy to spin a board in a banana costume for that price
Lmao right
From the guy who bought the billboard
I think you may be confused
Check u/PidgeonLover comment history, the guy who bought it
Yeah, I see
Check u/pidgeonlover comment history, he said it himself
We hugged the site
This reminds me of Cards Against Humanity’s infinite hole digging
Lest we forget the [Ron Paul blimp](https://reddit
And the op got 4 years of Reddit premium from the awards
Truly a Reddit moment
If all of the large banks are short even a single share, the suck will be on the order of trillions
I don't think the stock price will go to infinity, I am saying that the price at some point will be N/A
No, but if the number of shares in the pool become lower
I am not sure what would happen if there is literally *no* share available on the entire market for any price, but I guess we will see that when that happens
I know there is no guarantee of naked shorts
Opportunities are everywhere and i don’t see opportunities in the near future that can justify the amount of risk of market crash here
Could be
And you could very well be right; I'm not really even disagreeing with your thesis at all
Yeah that’s not market risk
Never said it was market risk
The risk of sitting out is zero
Opportunity cost is tied to the concept of risk, and can be viewed through that lens
But sure
You keep reading from a dictionary but continue to prove you don’t know what you’re talking about
I guess where we differ is that you think risk can only be losing what you already have
Where’s variation separate when you need him 😂
Honestly that’s already happening and is probably a smart play
When that happens we scoop up all the discounted gems
If you want us to hold just say it
You act as if all investments flow through Hedge funds
Seems like dumb advice
Stay the course
And hold GME
I had a taxable brokerage account with wealthfront that I’ve been auto depositing to with the intention of using it for a house down payment
Yes that's true, if you're young your time horizon is long enough it won't matter
Absolutely
It's much more than 20b
Man you really have no idea how little 120b is for institutional investors
You have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about and are advising people to move all of their money around
Don’t know why you are being downvoted, this guy is a conspiracy nut and giving horrible investment advice
Thanks for the feedback
Yes it has
There's this little thing called taxes
I'm talking about retirement accounts here - which aren't taxed for trading
Puts on SPY
You have a Source about that market crash scenario I can read through
One sec I'll edit this comment to link to some DD from yesterday or day before
Sincere thanks, I’ll watch for the edit
If this tanks enough other stocks I may be able to play too
This is completely ridiculous
But what do I know, I'm just a drinking bird pecking at a keyboard and this is not financial advice
Bonds are for 🌈🐻 buy GLD or SLV if your a retard near retirement
We love you too /u/SoggyEmpenadas
NO, ISSA STONK

Times Square now loves the stock
This just keeps getting better
We need billboards saying, **"Invest in your future, invest in America, invest in GME
Buy and hold\*
You guys are legends
We did it retards
The hedge fund guys will see this while traveling at terminal velocity towards the cement
Imagine some billionaire looking at this from their penthouse after losing millions
I JUST LIKE THE STOCK
Stonkies only go upsies
It’s crazy how GameStop is now the glitch of the century 🤣
Let me start of by saying that my account is only a few days old - in fact, I only created an account when WSB temporarily went private
And, I just want to let you know I am holding on to what little I've got, praying, cheering for you all and supporting in my own way
The events that've transpired from the past few days had made me realise that now might be more important than ever for me to write this - although it has taken me a thousand edits to conjure these few simple words
WE are with you on this, though you may not see us
Good luck and god speed
PS: This is not a financial advise (it clearly isn't) and not not a financial advisor (I am clearly not)
CONGRATULATIONS
What cross streets is this on
Autists, please check that your broker doesn't lend out your shares to shorters
It's called "securities lending" and a lot of brokers have it in their TOS
Can someone with more karma create a separate post about this please
Disclosure: i hold no shares in GME ( i don't think I ever bought it) and 30 in AMC ( Money is bagged in other stocks for now

I know it's poor vs rich but this sub has me thinking it's rich vs rich reddit users
People buying billboards could also be some who cashed out 30% of their gains or something
You dont buy the billboard, you rent it and often it loops between several adverts
Hahaha found the sub banner
I don't even
This is the way
Beyond awesome
Wait for it…
Ok now I'm worried we've jump the shark lol
Hahahahaha
You sir are a credit to the cause

Top tier meme

Oh you retard
I love how absolutely retarded this subreddit is
You did it
Any billboards up for rent on Wall St
That is now my favorite thing about NY
If I had an award, I'd give it to you
Any live cams out there that we can see this
What a time to be alive

Bro, why buy a billboard when u can buy more $GME
Love you autist, you are one of the best retard
This is what real revolution looks like
I like this stonk
New protections needed for 'unsophisticated' hedge fund managers
DUDE how much did you pay for this
It’s a beautiful thing
Time square
How's that working out lol
At a loss right now but it's picking up and I still believe the squeeze will happen
GME go brrrrrrrrrrr
It was 18 bucks an hour tho
We need manpower
Ads are more worth that what the ads cost, which is why ads exist 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I'm sure it costs way less now considering their is hardly anyone in times square now
Begun, the meme wars have
Let's run WORLD WIDE ADDS TO HOLD OR BUY $GME STOCK CAUSE WE ARE AUTISTS
Next step: get together and buy a Super Bowl ad
Is it too late to make money off of this insanity if I have like, 20$ and know precisely nothing about stonks
I live 5 min walk away from Times Square imma go check it out
Can we put all our money together and buy the Houston Texans
RH has extended to 50 shares the limit to buy GME

I freakn love it when average peops buy billboards and put these kind of messages
Have you guys seen this video from Jim Cramer
Someones gonna get fiiiired
I’m loving this next level trolling going on

You guys think you’re retarded
You cant stop this train

World is so much more interesting when more people have money
I am new to all of this and I want to do my part
What should I get 
They forgot the 10k price target
Apes - Let’s crush the hedgies
I don't have money for a billboard
Let’s go $GME
Not financial advice
One of the best things I’ve seen this year so far
I think my eye is leaking
Also my referbished Xbox 1 from GameStop Finally gave up after 2+ years (+ however long the previous owner(s) owned it which sheesh could be years) So if my donkey goes brrbrr we all know where I’m getting my next one
I LIKE THE STOCK 🚀
Love everything about this 🚀
Almost brings a tear to my eye
Various sources have vastly different figures
Unless I am reading incorrectly, it looks like some hedge funds/institutions have closed their short positions since the overall short % is down
Yahoo Finance say the short interest is 37
Finviz say 41
Highshortinterest say 78
Am I comparing like for like
This is the biggest flex I’ve ever seen
We should probably invest in some nets so they can't take the easy way out
My life is complete
From italy, 10 GME stocks at 330, I hava also 1000 usd left

Let me guess
I love how, for just a moment, we can all come together in unity
No love for AMC
Some one please make a billbord that says "We can remain retarded longer then you can stay solvent"
What if we joined together and didn’t sell out until the hedge funds make a collective deal with us
I’m going to liquidate all my stocks and go all in for GME
I bought one GME stock (all can afford without the wife knowing)
NOK NOK NOK 🚀🚀🚀

Endgame is coming
Let’s bring home the bacon
Let’s make it rain bucks and dollars for us
AMC and Nokia for loooooong run
Hello APES
The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy
When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers
The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares
By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral
Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares
Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price

We can hit 100k people an hour for 18 bucks, if they share even more
Fact checker Randy
Post it on front page
Brrr is referencing the noise of a money printer
It needs to go on for about two months for the last little naked short to go up in flames
If you invest in AMC over GME you quite literally have no idea what your doing
It's the same scenario with GME
No it’s not the same as GME
Where are you finding info about the length of the shorts
This should be it's own post bro
Not got enough karma :( Could you post
Sure I'll give it a shot
Much love from Canada

Actually the Rick Ashley Post has 50k more
Oh, nicee
Wait, what
I have no idea
That's odd
Yeah it looks like it
Reddit gave subs the option to unarchive stuff (you can comment on some posts posted 3 years ago)
It looks like a lot of different subs just stopped archiving threads
Is this like a glitch or something
I believe they made archiving posts optional for subreddits
Not sure, I'm awaiting a response on r/help atm
SI is still like 9x the float lmao
I'm surprised people are here

I LIKE THIS SUB
I just want to see the face of the nyse hedge fund losers in time square to clear their mind, getting dabbed on by this billboard
Beautiful
I think this guy really likes the stock 📈
Instead of giving money to such advertisements, you should buy shares from "gme" and compensate the damage of the victims to some extent
I love this I feel like we’re Spartans getting ready to fight the Persians
This made my balls tingle
Stronggggg💪💪
Just purchased my first stock ever
Any chance AMC will soar next week
WTF 
Another way to screw the rich over is to unfollow them on social media because they get paid for there followers 
Top all time, right

Speaking of to the moon, this just reached most upvoted reddit post OF ALL TIME
If I worked on wall street
We cannot be bargained with
I hope GameStop actually figures out a way to remain viable with the boost in revenue
What if
Or, maybe they could hire game designers and produce new games
Or they could be a child-sitting service that have games for kids to play while mom and dad go shopping
Imagine if they figure it out, and the hedgies need to take out a personal loan with a co-signer just to get tendies
Brain-storm for Gamestop here to really squeeze the hedgies
Amazeballs
I'm holding my 20 shares
They have to look at this all day

I literally took this literal and blew $8700
Trolls wall street on a god level

How much are you on by
Not quite, but it's currently the 4th most upvoted post on the entire website- 8 hours after it was posted
Greed, for lack of a better word
Never too late
This is not a way to make money in my opinion
Well, it *is* the most upvoted post
I concur
No rocket 😢
If times square is in, I'm in
I WAS HERE
You mad lads are making history
What a way to flex how much we like the stock🚀🚀🚀🌕
Is AMC next 
Yo
We bow to you sir
I understand everyone may hate this comment but AMC is owned by a Chinese company who forces control and censorship on the film industry
I bought AMC almost a year ago in the 1 to 2 dollar range and promptly sold it when I found this out
Should I buy the stock if I can only afford one
For people who feel they're too late to the party with GME, or think the shares are too expensive for them, check out AMC stocks
Sweden here
Just inserting my comment on this historical post
Let's make trending in twitter to reach more people
This is awesome
On all the billboards it would be cool to stress that we should hold GME to the end
I only see „going to the moon“, „until 5k“ and so on
This is getting out of had, what a time to be alive :)
Price of $GME will boom this week
Is amc still a target as well
Hi everybody
Just keep sharing this ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA #twitter
I think its beautiful 😀👌👆
Love Green Candles
What'a move
Guys, Eastern European countries are now in the Game
We love this stock
NOW THE INMATES ARE RUNNING THE ASYLUM
Thats
Can you do one with dogcoin :-) lost 50%
Guys, I could not be more impressed by this movement
What was done last week was amazing and it caught the world's attention
So, let’s not underestimate them the same way they have done to us all this time and let’s teach them a lesson that would live forever
Let’s show them how to do it by choosing a better cause
GME is a business that helped me to go through the life challenges and they deserve to survive, but there are other businesses that their main goal is to solve world problems and they are also struggling badly
House always wins, right
Name here the ETFs or stocks that deserve to be invested and let\`s do this before its too late and we lose our chance
I'm new here
Did you buy that
I  ♥️ the STOCK
Burrrrrrrrrrr
WE LIKE THE SDONK

I am looking for a digital billboard on US 101 as close to Robinhood's Menlo Park HQ (85 Willow Rd, Menlo Park, CA 94025)
I've seen 3 post now in the last 5 minutes, spelling "losing" as "loosing"
I went into a game stop today for the first time in years
Legendary moves
Government will soon end quarantine so we can go about our lives and get “distracted” again instead of sitting at home stonking
We need one of those showing Google supporting Robinhood
Man I am rock HARD right now, fellas
Haha
GTFOOH

Most upvoted reddit post and it's about the stock market
Why’s this downvoted
Really sorry for all the innocent people with 401Ks you might be hurting like your teacher when the market crashes on them
The market has been a 0 sum game with retail traders getting hurt for 100 years
Only this time there’s a bunch of retail traders on the winning side too
APES TOGETHER STRONG
You bought it
It’s almost as if once you start making money your movement has a fighting chance
The restrictions are real
Thought I'd introduce myself
Lol what are they gonna do when they all lose billions in silver
A friend of mine stopped talking to me because she works for Edward Jones and thinks we are not doing the right thing
Lmaooo I love it
HELL YEAH GME OR DIIEEEEEEEEEE
This is a timeline I enjoy quite fondly
I love how 2021 is pulling an uno reverse 🔄 on 2020
This is the best free advertising campaign EVER
This isn’t about money anymore, it’s a movement we‘re all in
What about BB and nok
Oh it told that me too, I was really skeptic about it as well haha
Please tell me :(
Ohh ok thanks
Great
Yup, thx for pointing that out
We’re all retarded
Webull would you like an invite
Nobody who’s here was there
How much did you make
Any other stocks we should be looking at
Payback for 2000 and 2008 
Ornamental gourds are the next GME
Is it worth buying a few shares on Monday
I got fired this week
APES
TOGETHER
I’m not very old so this might be the best thing that happened in my life
Everyone Focused on GME Right now but as you noticed, many brokers allow only 1 share atm
Anyone have any AMC NOK predictions
I’m afraid of what happens when this is no longer trending
Let’s hold GME and AMC to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀
Its time for AMC 
Would you guys help a fellow investor I'm mean I'm nobody but I'd appreciate it if we could rally up behind amc a bit more
Am I too late to the party
Maybe but amc could use your patronage
I got some AMC 40 shares
Will this be the most upvoted post ever
If GME hits $1000 can we get AOC to show us her tits
NOK NOK NOK NOK
AMC monday
The law firms Williams Attorneys PLLC and Watts Guerra LLP have teamed up to bring justice to the multitude of traders who were wronged by Robinhood's halt on the purchase of multiple stocks, including but not limited to $GME and $AMC

When I see that someone with enough money to buy a billboard in NYC
AMC/GME It was amazing to watch how a group of like minded people can change the world when they work as a unit
What’s the next stock
Whats going on with the AMC stocks
What other stocks should we buy and hold 🧐
Have to be careful of the potential bulltrap when these short calls expire
Let me know when you start with BB
Please take notice of heavily shorted and manipulated Soliton $soly
Tell me this ain’t a scene out of idiocracy
These people hate us
Euro ape paying respects
STNE IS THE NEW GME , GO RRR

J P Morgan
Can hyliion get some love
Check out BAO financial
I am a gold and silver guy
No one would benefit more from a #silversqueeze than me
Don't let people parachute in and co-opt our movement
They're either hedge fund plants, fedposting or washed-up boomers and junior mining players who have been irrelevant and underwater for years
The goal is to crush the shorts and get rich
Anything other then that, we run the risk of financial ruin
We're not here in a crusade to beat the bullion banks or crush the COMEX
That's fighting the boomers' war
Like most things over the past 60 years, they were to selfish and self-absorbed to do anything about it
Don't let these ossified has-beens distract you
If they were of any use, they would have solved their own problems
We will show them how it's done
All in on $GME or nothing
After we win that one, we can circle back and consider bailing them out
Until then, don't call us, we'll call you
No distractions, no surrender
Ok fine but what about Nokia and AMC
Wouldn't be surprised if it went into the 20s
On Monday or is that it’s height
AMC follows GME so we good
Did you really just type this out and press submit
They seem really expensive right now
AMC is cheaper and in a good position
Not in a GME position
Not in a GME position
Thank you, I'll try that now
Do yourself a favor and click on the account of every last person pushing AMC
You got AMC shares
Gamestop gaming outlet
Thanks wise redditor, I am not American or European so I don't know alot about this, but I get the general idea
Likewise
I KNOW all the scumbags promoting it
I work in the gold and silver business
It's a trap
N- 14 O- 15 K- 11  = Price target $1425
I’ve got 15 shares of AMC and 16 shares of NOKIA 
Buy buy buy spce
Which other HF is shorting a stock(s)
These brokers lend out our (good people) shares of stock in companies to be used against us
Then they Buy to Cover and move on and we lose the money
In order to win somebody's got to lose
And its Legal
I give more respect to the guy who puts on the black sweatsuit, Ski mask and gloves and goes out in the middle of the night to pull a real heist
Imagine being a starving Guatemalan and living off $1 a day and seeing that Americans in their decadence have spent you and your entire village's life giving income on having this billboard up for a minute, day, week, whatever
Cvm go up 🚦✈🕟🌪
Citadel got papyrus hands

Legitimate question: I don’t invest and I own no gme
Just read Amazon might buy AMC if you don’t believe go look er up all I know is AMC is reaching a all time high come next week get ready boys 🚀🚀
I’ll be in on Monday
Why buy a billboard when you could've bought more of the stock 🤦
Anyways AMC GME NOK go burrrrrrrr
What’s the next big one 
Would you all agree everyone left in here over the weekend still holding after last weeks -40% cuz robinghood thursday just diamond hands holding or dying
Yea I think a ton of people got scared because lots of first timers have to wait on their money and sold what they had
Imagine how high the stock would go if you let us newbees in
Dammit Reddit, why wont you play video
I hate v
Are there any alternatives angles of this because this would be so easy to fake
Who owns GME
Came in a little too late to the GME party when the stock was trading really low however I’m all in on the next GME which is obviously AMC
The only
Why tho
AMC and NOK
What about nokia

Can’t wait for SLV TO HIT THE MOON
I am a gold and silver guy
No one would benefit more from a #silversqueeze than me
Don't let people parachute in and co-opt our movement
They're either hedge fund plants, fedposting or washed-up boomers and junior mining players who have been irrelevant and underwater for years
The goal is to crush the shorts and get rich
Anything other then that, we run the risk of financial ruin
We're not here in a crusade to beat the bullion banks or crush the COMEX
That's fighting the boomers' war
Like most things over the past 60 years, they were to selfish and self-absorbed to do anything about it
Don't let these ossified has-beens distract you
If they were of any use, they would have solved their own problems
We will show them how it's done
All in on $GME or nothing
After we win that one, we can circle back and consider bailing them out
Until then, don't call us, we'll call you
No distractions, no surrender
I know it’s super neat to participate in this, but be honest, buying stock in game stop won’t do anything for people who have been killed by the institution, and it certainly won’t change the game

This is what GME money looks like
Do AMC too pllllzzzz

GME is overvalued and going to crash
Same to you AH
GTFO you bot
GME is not worth more than $20 a share
What’s the next 🔥ticker

A smile knowing that somewhere out there, there's a 🌈🐻 hedge fund 5'2" shorty crying himself to sleep somewhere on earth while you're chilling in your wife's boyfriend's basement on the moon

I like 2021 so far
I love the stock
Thankfully, most people are blissfully unaware of the painfully retarded “*noun* goes brrr” meme, so they’ll probably think this has to do with Robinhood freezing purchases of that stock
Never too late

Guys i have a problem
Insanely AWESOME
If you are being denied GME in USD on your platform, try GS2C which is Game Stop on the German exchange in euros
This makes me kinda proud hahah
I really dislike fox news but Charles Payne is correct let people decide what they want and not have hedge funds or government interfere
LFG GME TO $1000 next week
Where's AMC 🚀🚀🚀🚀😭😭😭😭
Remindme bot didn’t even have time to remind me about this before it happened
Keep it up and the government will suddenly halt the ability of private citizens to purchase billboard ad space

That's a 'Retard' billboard if I ever saw one 😘
I Love WSB
The funny thing about "The Big Short" is the story being told from the guys who predicted the collapse
Brilliant
Today, I was telling someone about this people vs Hedgies war
A billboard like this is like a big middle finger
I am now more than ever persuaded: There will be BOOKS written about it
Why not buy stock instead
What does GME open @ Monday
Only been here a day or two, but the hype is infectious so got me some GME

Sell a call buy a equally away from the money put with the premium and all gains a locked in and they can hold for two YEARS with 2023 LEAPS
I’m just a humble moron and this is not financial advice, I’m just curious how this might work, asking for learning purposes

Im looking to try and do the same here in Philadelphia on I-95
This is epic
You people are insane

Play the bee movie on it
IT WOULD BE FUNNY
Is that way the mods were asking for people with video skills and voice actors the other day
Thats the most beautiful and retarded thing I can imagine
Wait, whaaaaat
This is amazing, happy to be part of this moment of history
Nailed it
Whenever I hear the hedge funds are in [trouble:](https://getyarn
What a waste instead of saying hold
Love this 
Holy $$$hit
I just got done catching up on The Stand
Trashcan man reminds me a lot of this sub
LMAO
What’s the difference between red and green
When is the movie coming out
Any Dutchies in here up to crowdfund a highway billboard
A week of commercials is around €2
Can't wait to watch the Internet Hisorian video on this

We can’t be stopped
The true heroes
You all should check out blip

NYC on the map 🗺💎🖐🏽

YOU ARE A 💎💎💎💎💎
Should I still buy amc at $13
At this rate the short squeeze will literally last a day instead of a flash hour
Aren’t hedge funds now set up for a bigger play in shorting
That's one step over madlad: Derrangedfellow
Love to see it
Let’s give it
Does anyone know if it’s still there 
Wish I had money to be a part of this

It took a moment for my phone to load this, so the billboard was blank except for a small green box with upward pointing line, down in the bottom left corner
Ganhar dinheiro baixando o Kwai
Are we still buying
Too bad looks like no one can see it with everyone being cleared out from Covid

Is that real
Man, and all I did was design a bumper magnet
Can someone please explain the sign to a newb
Everyone is buying AMC is that true 
I am a gold and silver guy
This said, we must Win $GME first
Don't let people parachute in and co-opt our movement
The goal is to crush the shorts and get rich
Anything other then that, we run the risk of financial ruin
We're not here in a crusade to beat the bullion banks or crush the COMEX
That's fighting the boomers' war
Like most things over the past 60 years, they were to selfish and self-absorbed to do anything about it
Don't let these ossified has-beens distract you
If they were of any use, they would have solved their own problems
We will show them how it's done
All in on $GME or nothing
After we win that one, we can circle back and consider bailing them out
Until then, don't call us, we'll call you
I love this
WHERE IS THIS 
Viva la revolution
Don’t get me wrong I’m all in on AMC
No 🚀🚀🚀 to 🌕

It's kind of dumb to say right now that GME will go up to the moon
What a time to be alive
What is our next move
One day i will ask this stock to merry me

You are all mad
This is just amazing, you are a legend
I'm one of the newbies on this site
Melvin gotta stop downvoting you guys
That's Awsome can't wait to be on the winning team 😎
No because the only ones pushing AMC are ONE karma accounts
Because the only people pushing AMC are one karma bot accounts such as yourself trying to get people away from GME
Lol what😂 I’m just asking a question jeez

The world is changing and the old school are late to adapt
I love this community so much

Can we get a kickstart for a $BB sign
I'm recently married, out of work due to herniating a couple discs in my back, broke as fuc and in a lot of debt, and with me being out of work the past couple months my employer has lost a couple of our large accounts, and I have been informed that even when I am healthy again that my job is no longer available to me because they won't be able to pay me due to their loss of revenue
With all of that being said
No I do not have any deluded aspirations of getting rich off of my one or two shares, and I fully understand the consequences, and the high probability that I will lose it all
But some things are bigger than us as individuals

For the longest I really thought a lot of people forgot about the 2008 financial crisis which these greedy pigs created on top of that the people lose but they end up gaining so much and for that I said we need to work together with the government and tell the government no more bill out for big business or for Wall Street Only bailout should go to the people
Couldn’t you include AMC, BB & NOK

In 2021, we may not be able to change the greed and exploitation on Wall Street, and may not become billionaires, but you reminded the world to pay attention to fairness, reminded those people to know the fact that water can carry ships or sink ships, this The year will be written into the annals of history, and every participant will be a member of this shocking world history and be proud of you
This is a movement 
Wouldnt it be better to start buy gme dircetly on monday to push the stock price even more instead of waiting for a dip at 200$ of smth
Thats not a Financial Advice and just an Open Question

Hop on Fidelity
Exactly
By prohibiting users from increasing their position, Robinhood is instilling fear and subliminally encouraging investors to sell
As a soon to be former robinhooder, where else supports free trading
Edit- well I guess no one is gonna answer me
We’re getting to them
They’ve also cancelled all orders I’ve had with them from last night
I go all in
We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules "to protect" us
People are saying they can’t trade gme on Robinhood right now
THE SCUMBAGS CANCELED THE ORDER THAT I PUT IN LAST NIGHT 3 MINUTES BEFORE OPENING
I’m contacting a lawyer immediately
They will pay dearly for this
I made a list of the four people have been talking about here and none of them are "supported by robinhood at this time,"
They need to be sued
Someone please list down all the available alternative to purchase
Time to cancel robinhood for selling out
If we all HOLD
I'm calling it
The good ol boys club ends in 2021
The whole movement is a screw you statement to the market manipulators
We've broke reddit and brokerage apps, gotten support by powerful people, made it in the media, reddit and robinhood were the top trending apps
We got this
It won’t let you buy them
I’m witnessing internet history
It's no longer about making money, it's about sending a message
THIS IS MARKET MANIPULATION PURE AND SIMPLE AND HIGHLY ILLEGAL
RH, CNBC, Citadel, and Melvin Capital are all participating in market manipulation
Longtime lurker here
RIP Robinhood
THIS is market manipulation
REMEMBER, THE MORE YOU HOLD AND BUY, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THE HEDGEFUNDS TO SHORT-COVER----> PRICES EVEN HIGHER ON THE STOCK
DO NOT SELL ON THOSE BROKERS THAT DON\*T ALLOW BUYING
FINAL BOARDING CALL
NOT FINANCIAL ADVISOR, DO YOUR DD
REMEMBER, THE MORE YOU HOLD AND BUY, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THE HEDGEFUNDS TO SHORT-COVER----> PRICES EVEN HIGHER ON THE STOCK
DO NOT TRANSFER YOUR ACCOUNT IF MOVING TO A NEW BROKER
Obviously not financial advice
People like those stocks
What is the problem
They're gonna lose in their upcoming IPO
NOT GONNA SELL AT 1K, NOT GONNA SELL AT 10K BECAUSE CNBC/MELVIN LIED, NOT GONNA SELL UNTIL 100K
How ironic that *Robinhood* is screwing over the little guy
Couldn't robinhood and other traders blocking of stocks be argued to be a refusal to supply and against FTC regulations
Goes to show how much they stand to lose
My $ is dropping hard as hell, but at this point i’m just pissed off, i could care less what i lose, holding till this is done
It's not WSB selling
These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price
Every share they sell is borrowed
Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen
This is a repost
We like the stock
You know who hasn't blocked buying of shares
Where can I buy gme right at this moment
First I was a bit angry that the big boys have been screwing us
Robinhood literally doesn’t allow people to buy only to sell
This whole saga is highlighting how everything is stacked against the common person
AMC is at 9
According to the Verge, Google salvaged Robinhood’s one-star rating by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews
I unfortunately can’t, as I’m on robinhood
Gamers everytime
Just joined the sub
I am in AMC and now buying some GME because they deserve it
This post is now the 3rd most upvoted post in Reddit history
Feels almost nostalgic finding this post again
It's not WSB selling
These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price
Every share they sell is borrowed
Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen
This is a repost
I  have them saved and it says they no longer sell those on their platform
What is an alternative app
AMC to the moon
My 19 shares of NOK just went through
Wow RH
Time to short robinhood
Mark Cuban, Dave Portnoy, AOC, and many others have already raised concerns on Twitter against Robinhood
GME is far from over
Didn't the Melvin group publicly say they closed their position with gme
Thats it, that seals the deal, Im no longer a Robinhood trader
I heard they removed GameStop and BB
I went over to cashapp and unlike AMC GME doesn't even show up when searched
Life finds a way
When ya gotta go ya gotta go
HOLDDDDDDD
The hedge funds are terrified and calling in any dirty favors they can
If this isn't proof the entire market is just a rigged casino for a select few gamblers, then I don't know what is
They just canceled my buy this morning
I dont know why people are acting like BB, NOK and AMC are same as GME
I think many new autists here heard about short squeeze for the first time otherwise they would understand that these others tickers can still be shorted legally and have enough available float
If you are gonna buy these other meme stocks, make sure you actually see some opportunity for long term growth or you might lose everything
We can’t buy that’s the problem
Just keep holding
So Robinhood sold me shares of a stock yesterday but won't let other users purchase them today
The hid BB as well
I lost 30% cause of RH
AMC is at $9
I’m not selling it but where does it go from there
Edit
Trying to search GME on robinhood
Edit: Jumped over to Fidelity
So BB has dropped wildly by almost 40%, why hasn't Robinhood stopped from people from selling it
FIDELITY WORKING FOR AMC
I got a free share of GameStop last March when I downloaded Robinhood
It's not WSB selling
These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price
Every share they sell is borrowed
Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen
This is a repost
Guys, hold everything
Bankrupting Robinhood is the next logical step right
Just bought 700 shares in NOK
Stop a stock from trading because it's going up and billionaires are losing money
Everyone hold AMC
So what’s the next stock to buy
NOK it to the moon  🚀🌙
R/WallStreetBetsELITE is banding together to hold and buy AMC tomorrow
Anyone else moving all funds off of robinhood once possible
We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules "to protect" us
Robinhood tells me that Bitcon cannot be sold right now
Bought 5k NOK and AMC
HOLD AMC AND RELOAD NOW
Nok to the moon
Bet Robinhood had shorts against GME
THE SQUEEZE did NOT HAPPEN YET
Otherwise open an account at another brokerage, and do the same thing
Lastly, you can request all shares be transferred to another the brokerage
Seems Robinhood will be holding the line here
Forget Robinhood
Send the dogs
Thank you comrade
What
Getting citadel bribe $
WT has it, and all free
Are you talking about Wealth Simple
Ah I was looking at signing up to that one around a month ago but then I remembered I'm poor so I had nothing to trade lol
Toss that CRB in there :D
How long does it take to verify financing with wealth simple
Took 3 days for the funds to finally land after flight
Yea but NOK and AMC still available over there
Lmao ad
Literally what type of trader since 1982 doesn’t have an account with an a discount brokerage more fleshed out than Cashapp
Hold your stocks my friend and then let RobinHood rot afterwards
It will go back up just HOLD
Don't worry you'll make money
Thats the life, G
I did too, but nothing I couldn’t afford to lose
Never heard of any of them lol
I'm on Fidelity and I see no bid or asks for $AMC 
Fidelity has proven that they are for the people
I cant even get it to load
Yes it is
How do you sell and buy In another simultaneous
It's actually hilarious because Donald Trump JR and AOC are saying the same things
So what you’re saying is I should buy NOK and AMC Rn if I can
AMC BB and GME is all open on E*TRADE
GME INTO THE SUNSET BOYS
These Wall StREETards forgot that the stock market is about the individual and social buyer psychology (esp
How much of a short interest remains on $GME, $AMC, $BB
Do they realize this group is over 2x larger than when this all started
Do they realize there are institutional funds/VIPs/politicians that are sympathetic to our cause
What do we use now instead of robinhood
CEO of Robinhood about to be interviewed on CNBC in a few minutes
If they would've just taken their losses early none of this would have happened
Soo should I invest in gme now
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A FREE MARKET ECONOMY AND THE MARKETS ARE ABOUT SPONSORING COMPANIES WE LOVE
What, is it our fault they bet on $GME shutting down losing thousands of jobs and leaving gamers without a say
I swear, boomers are upset we beat the house on a market they treat as a casino
I would love you guys to spread the word that on a recent news hour, some bald beaurocrat actually came out and said, while defending holding off giving us another stimulus payment, that they're trying to look at the data related to the GME sales because "that's not what we gave them money for
Bought me 4 shares and of AMC and plan on buying some GME this weekend when I get paid
Well this aged well, unlike robinhood
Switch to ETRADE
Still holding on to $BB $AMC $NOK
But if no one can buy it how will it go up
Would it be too late to get involved in this
I had to use cash app to by a amc stock they would not let me buy more they are black balling us because we have found the flaw in the system
FOR ANYONE PISSED OFF ABOUT THIS, please screenshot / document this market manipulation by Robinhood and email evidence and contact info to [RobinhoodLawsuit69@gmail
Cash app hid GME and is blocking buy orders for AMC an NOK
Ally suspended my account access online after trading AMC and BB
I WANT TO BUY ON ROBINHOOD
I put my money into this app, let me use it
Where is the AMC love
It's not as simple as just changing platforms though
Manipulation at its finest
If this isn’t an illegal Cheat Mode for Wall Street, what is
Please investigate communications between this brokerage and the hedge funds who fund them and would likely profit off of the restricted trading of the security
Can someone explain why we should buy NOK
HOLD
There was no reason to do this other than benefitting hedge funds and the wall street establishment
It is pulling back guys, now at $196
Where do I go to buy now that robinhood is done
Where is the SEC now that legitimate, fraudulent market activity (or lack thereof) created by Robinhood has been exposed
Remember they can cancel trading for traditional stonks but not for cryptos DOGE coin to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
I feel like companies don't understand a really simple rule
Just bought two more tendies cause WETARD
Boycott , delete and sue Robinhood 🤗

How can I buy buy buy
I know many of us who trade on Robinhood will be transferring/closing out accounts with them
It's a wonderful thing to see so many people get on our side and help the effort
It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze
DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY
It's not guaranteed to
Repost credit u/OurLordOfWar

They really need to have a chat with Barbara Streisand
Can’t wait 😜
Yes
Yes
AMC rising so fast, I had to reduce the number of stocks 3 times before I could get an order in
It won’t
When I search for it on Robinhood, it doesn't show up
RH and others are blocking buys of GME but allowing sales
Good thing i just sold out of both twitter and square
Let’s go 
Let’s go 
We can try
I'm just going to hold no matter what
I will buy alot now 
Reach out to your Congress person and senators and let them know about this stock manipulation that is being pulled by Wall Street
It worse
Robinhood just cancelled my purchase of NOK
Those stocks are no longer supported by Robinhood
I bought stock yesterday and got a message on Robin Hood at 6am that I cancelled it
RH just cancelled my pre orders, these guys are tools for the establishment
What kills me is thaybis says 'you've canceled 
The Streisand Effect is about to present itself
DID YALL JUST SEE THAT GME UP TO 400 wtf
Had to switch to E-Trade, but I bought more GME
The way these boomers reacted to this has shown they still do not understand the internet
Wow, Robinhood should rename itself to Prince John
How can I buy
WTF is going on this morning
We need Mr
Beast to drop a load for us 🚀🚀🚀 I know he wants to go to the moon
BB and NOK tanked double digits, what gives
This is just the proof how the stocks are completely controlled by the big wallets
How is restricting stock purchases a legal act by these brokers

I'm using wealthsimple in Canada and works great
AMC dipping

Fidelity keeps giving me an error message every time I confirm my purchase for AMC

They also blocked American Airlines
Imagine when the billionaires ask for another chance on their losses or to settle & we say eh
WE TAKING THE POWER BACK #fightthepower
They won’t let us buy buy buy
AMC is around $10 now
I was able to get in with Fidelity
TD ameritrade still has them up
Anyone anyone found a workaround to buy these off Robin Hood
Amc @10
I only have $3k on Robinhood but I think I might wait til my options (mostly weed stocks) expire and them close it
Not only did they hide from search but AMC is completely unavailable to buy on RH now, cancelled my limit buys
This just in, if you search in the top 100 you can still find GME
I can't wait to see the Netflix Limited Series of this when it's all over
I’m using the Gatsby app to trade options for GME and AAL
WEBULL STILL ALLOWS GME PURCHASE
WealthSimple for the win
Is what Robin Hood is doing right now more obviously market manipulation than anything GME related that’s happened before
I just switched to Fidelity but now I can't make a transfer til my bank account is approved
BUY BUY BUY WERE GOING TO THE MOON BOYS ALL ABOARD THE TENDY ROCKET
Hell, cash app lets you trade
Leave reviews on App Store, force Google and Apple to remove the app from their own stores, and let their company drown
I’d
US citizens can use it
Fidelity lets you buy
You can't buy there either
HMM
You serious
Something fishy is happening and I do not like it
People
How do we know HF aren’t buying right now while we only have the option to sell
Robinhood now says “we no longer support this stock” - you’re telling me that’s not manipulation worthy of SEC violation
If we can sell but cannot buy then who is the buyer
System is corrupt
Everybody don't forget to leave an app review for Robin hood, Trading212 etc
I even got desperate and tried to buy AMC in cashapp and it wouldn't let me
AMC buy the dip
Robinhood had a 4
This is some sec /executive order stuff

Boyos
They took our parent's money, They took our money to bail themselves out and give themselves a fat bonus, now we take wallstreets money
Jokes on them if I sell another stock I'll get marked for day trading 😎
I can still get AMC and NOK through Cashapp, Just bought shares a few mins ago
After everything that has happened over the last 12 months I can not believe we aren’t in an alternate timeline
WSB trolled
As soon as I can buy GME again I’m doubling down
GME: 120 to 273
Canadian here
Imagine if we did this regularly
I'm a medical student, not in America but still will be 60k€ in debt when I'm done in two years
I have 8 shares, bought 7 at 91 and another one at 295
I hoped it might make a dent in the end, but we right now I don't even give a fick anymore, I will take my shares to my grave if it means these villains bleed
So is it smart to go into $NOK if we can
I believe this is the transition from old money to new money
Ok serious talk
If everyone buys a stock and holds it, where do new stocks come from
Bought some NOK shares yesterday
Wall Street: "It's a free market
I just started catching wind of this in the last couple weeks
They also hid BB
I see today as a discount and as soon as these cry babies let me back in to buy I will buy more GME
AM I too late to help
Together we are strong
I believe my GME stock would be worth $250,000 today had my free speech not been illegally detained by Citadel Investments (Robinhood)
If Robinhood and your exsisitng brokers aren't letting you buy stocks you want, why aren't you moving to another broker
After market closes
Storm the Citadel

Everyone saying last comment, no you are not
I was able to buy GME on webull like an hour ago

Alternate platforms may be an option as well as a back up plan🤷🏽‍♂️
The problem is, the stuff we're promoting here is rebellious

Unable to link bank to fidelity, etrade and webull
I had placed a market order for open last night and it went through
Let the people trade
RH also said you can close your holdings but not but anymore stock for me
My order for AMC was force-cancelled by Robinhood just two minutes before open
Time for a lawsuit
Dude I got in on $Nok & $AMC before, I was trying to buy more on CashApp today but I keep getting an error
BB gone too
I'm retard and dumb, what should I do
Everyone needs to start leaving negative reviews on the IOS and Android app stores

Send error complaints to Robinhood support that you’re unable to find GME on their platform
BB is hidden too
I’d also like to point out the Sundial Growers, #SNDL has been taken off the search function as well as AMC and a bunch of other stocks through robinhood
What the hell happened to the GameStop stock I bought yesterday though
Edit: they executed the order but now you can only sell
I don’t have access on robinhood what should I use instead
How is this legal
Whats the over/under on RH lifting restrictions
I was able to buy AMC on ameritrade at 705am pst today
Are people here actually going to follow through 
I'm kinda stupid and new to trading, how else do we buy if we can't through RH
AMC seems to be the only thing we can buy right now
I have steered clear of gme for my own risk tolerance but I will be leaving robinhood over this
LOL good luck with the IPO robinhood
Considering Citadel handles their order flow, it's amazing what a conflict of interest this is for them
Retards, never forget which brokers screwed us up during this
RH canceled my BB and can’t buy AMC and GME 🤬🤬🤬 can you buy them on Fidelity
Do cashapp invest in Nokia (NOK)
Robinhood has blocked the buying of GME completely
THIS AIN’T CHINA
Flood app store reviews with this
I placed orders last night, they were cancelled by Robinhood this morning
No one buying $NOK
But when a bunch of ordinary joes like us get together online and decide to buy a stock, our "illicit" activities need to be POLICED and our pick gets HALTED
Someone buy one for $420
Wait, I bought five AMC shares on Wealthsimple yesterday
Now that amount in my TFSA is steadily dropping
Edit: Now $76
Edit 3: $61
Can we throw some support towards AMC and BB on the platforms where those can still be bought and sold
Same with TD ameritrade
You know what's sad
Still a good time to buy more NOK, BB, AMC, and GME now

And BB NOK BBBY
Can we tank the reviews on the Robinhood app for not supporting us retards in our endeavors
They’re deleting reviews on the App Store wtf
On Robinhood I have been capturing Candlestick GIFS of the GME movements from the open, with their "You can only sell
They collaborated to release false news stories and promoted them on multiple platforms
They attempted to smear and besmirch the reputations of the intellectually and fiscally disabled
This was intended to cause harm by attempting to generate a panic sell-off aka Flash-crash at the open, by releasing these things after hours
When that failed, they caused harm by restricting the trades
They have organized this amongst many Media and Financial Institutions across State lines
Somebody get Rico on the line
I cant get gme or amc in UK
Go to Schwab, Fidelity, or E-Trade to get GME
I don't like this dude but upvoted for support
I am entirely, completely out of the loop, can someone please give me a rundown of what exactly is happening here
Just threw another $50 at AMC
Bought 15 stocks on NOK
The lower GME and AMC dip the more we buy
Just bought $10k  worth of AMC while it is on sale
Were you able to cancel your money transfer in the app itself
I did it on the website under Account > Banking
Apparently you can only do it on the same day you initiate, I put money in yesterday preparing for today so robinhood screwed me
That sucks that your money is stuck with RH until it clears - I guess I got lucky that I work overnight and didn't get a chance to move the money until in the middle of the night
Same, Robinhood is shooting themselves in the foot
Actually
And now I cannot even connect to fidelity
Most places will reimburse that fee
Yes, look how many people on this board aren’t able to buy, as soon as these apps work again amc Nok and bb are shooting up
We must have bought at the exact same time
Why NOK serious question cause I’ll buy if it’s a good idea
I’ll leave another every day
Blocked out in UK for AMC and GME
Democrats have already spoken out on it and is demanding a review
Link
I tried to sign up to e trade and it didn’t let me
Managed to buy $75 worth of NOK
They hid blockbuster
DO NOT FOLD PEOPLE
Meant to say 300 shares LOL
I’m so pissed I literally grabbed more money and went through fidelity
Trader 212 not talking any more new people
Bought another 20 shares on Schwab
E*TRADE is working
SoFi still works
Y’all are taking advice from faze banks
Bought AMC on Vanguard this AM looks like you still can as of 10:30AM/CT
WTF
BUY the DIPS
CashApp has hidden those stocks too
I don't think TD or Schwab has delisted the stocks from their site yet, so try those
Can buy Nok & AMC via cash app
Yup, just bought another 2 shares with all the money I have
How am I supposed to buy
Just bought some AMC
Just got this on [Public
Ally also restricting GME purchases
The Streisand Effect
What was their reason for blocking even looking at the stock price
I’m deleting RH over this
NOOOO my order got canceled and I never got in :(
Check your local financial conduct authority if you don't live in UK and do the same
PLEASE REPOST
NOK is going UP UP UP
So should I buy all those stonks
FIDELITY STILL WORKING
Get this stuff on the news
They need to be judged in the public eye
Time to make robinhood tank
Well there goes Robinhood’s integrity
I bought today, so proud of all you internet nerds gaming the system
Buying the dips in AMC
FWIW, it looks like there's no restrictions over on Etrade
Just came here to say we’ve emptied our emergency fund for this

Do the opposite of what the MSM tells you
All gold users should demand a refund of their gold fee for this month
Can still buy $NOK on fidelity
I'm fighting on the AMC front
Hey, so I’m just a chud who found this because of all the ruckus around the GameStop stock
Let's give robinhood app some 1 star rating, the legend Robinhood took side with the poor not the rich
Citadel is a hedge fund that owns Melvin Capital Management
Melvin is a $GME short seller predicted to lose BILLIONS due to the people taking the free market back
Citadel owns the app Robinhood
Citadel banned purchases of new $GME shares on RH
Market manipulation
If we can only sell, who's buying
Question from a retard
The hedge funds who need to buy those shares
Hold my stonk, we're going to the moon
Etrade is still selling AMC, NOK, and GME
From India here
Can't find AMC
Would be swell if we can actually buy
Hold and buy more $AMC and $GME
Robinhood is not available in my country
I was able to buy AMC on etrade today
I hope we get a Boiler Room 2 out of this story line
We are Anonymous
Who do we transfer our accounts to
GME and AMC
Is the app called sofi Hong Kong on the App Store
No just SoFi
Nope
Are you [certain](https://twitter
Joining you there
I was in the same spot last night
So if collectively we set sell limits to 10k there forced at that

Okay, so how about now
You guys are chicken soup for my soul
Dodge coin is the wave

The RobinHood gay bears have chosen the dark side
I believe my GME stock would be valued at $250,000 today had citadel investments (Robinhood) not illegally detained my free speech
My STASH app won’t let me buy
Just got an email from Robinhood saying they will be graciously allowing limited buys tomorrow
I aint no one with cash,do what ,and then what
I wouldn't say legitimately at all, more like illegitimately
I noticed this as well when searching for GME
Im proud of you boys
This is the 4th most upvoted reddit post of all time
Yo let's brake there ankles
They cancelled my NOK order this morning
Stellar Lumen next
Why are some people saying not to buy any AMC shares
My bank set a $50 limit on wire transfers to "protect" my account
Robinhood: we are having technical difficulties that are in no way related to the obvious relief this would give our partners
Support me with some upvotes
Buy more NOK gang, stop sell it u retards
I just bought a bit of amc and nok
Okay hear me out
What Is the next move

The guy tweeting owned a csgo gambling site that rigged odds and created fake accounts that “won” to drive more people to join
Hi, I have $885 to spend and im new to buying stocks
I placed order for them
Use me as a GME STOCK BUY BUTTON FOR MONDAY
Short-selling hedge funds have suffered a mark-to-market loss of $19
Still, short sellers mostly are holding onto their bearish positions or they are being replaced by new hedge funds willing to bet against the stock
GameStop shares that have been borrowed and sold short have declined by just about 5 million over the last week, marking an 8% dip in the short interest, according to S3
What’s happening with BB and NOK
Let’s go
Holding AMC, NOK, SNDL
Doing it because I want to and to help short squeeze
Heard some cocky bear over on Stocktwits brag about a put he has out for March 19 for $50/share
So, I am as newb and naive as possible, I’ve worked for others for forty five years, time to work for myself, is there a viable alternative to Robinhood
How is nok the 2nd most popular stock on rh lol
I'm new to this but live what you're doing and want to be a part of it
Seems like the scumbag hedge fund   companies are shorting FSR
It was in the low 20's, got a price target of $26 then crashed to 14 and has been stuck at $15 for months
Buy Fisker
APES TOGETHER STRONG
Just joined love you tough people
PS, great idea of the user that is buying life saving heart surgeries for those 2 children

RH froze me out big time
I’m done with RH freezing me out this week
I am here to join the resistance, how do I going about buying w/o RH
Where can I go to actually buy shares of GME
I can only afford 1 share of GME
But why isn't AMC going up 
Just new to this
ITS TIME TO BUY AMC
BUY AMC ALL YOU CAN
Hey, so $GME is cheap today
That’s weird I bought three of those stocks you listed
Hope GME rebounds
Now even Revolut aren't letting people buying
If they do win because of manipulation are we organizing a protest and pulling funds out of stocks
SALE SALE SALE
You guys are hero's
Robinhood buying a 5
Cash I can afford to lose
Can we make GE go up cause it's one stock I can actually afford

Yea, to "protect" us
Buy NOK NOW
Thank you very much
I’ll only invest here from now on and stay with this platform so I can work with everyone else here, working together
They won't even approve my application and don't respond
Anyone got a good one I can call
I CAN'T WAIT FOR 2021s year in review/recap in December Before New Years
Faze banks took that info, reiterated it
The RH bs just prove it
The elites dont know how to lose
Honestly they tanked, blaming it on robinhood is understandable but I think the hedge funds would’ve won this one anyway
I didn’t tho
Anyone else feel that they should not have used those terms
One of the billionaires will try to claim terrorism
It's like the guy who got arrested for saying he was about to blow the restroom up
So when can we expect robinhood to face market manipulation charges
Since this post will go down in the history books I wanna say that Noita is a really good game and it is really fun and I really want multiplayer
I'm pretty sure they did it to PLTR and BB too
I am not a American citizen
You can, but it will eventually be handled by the SEC, which will eventually go nowhere meaningful
Just wanna say I was here
I bought Nokia shares and options
Keep buying AMC
Yes apes let's buy in to nokia to the moon and vxrt
I invested in WKHS due to future technology
The whole movement is a screw you statement to the market manipulators
We've broke reddit and brokerage apps, gotten support by powerful people, made it in the media, reddit and robinhood were the top trending apps
Hold the door and don't let them win
We got this
Yea buy physical silver
I'm sorry so we are following the words of a multi millionaire who gave coke to kids he employed, now
Too bad this tweet didn’t matter at all
You were saying
This dude is a con man
BUY THE AMC DIP NOW
Robinhood might be screwed on this one
AMC is crashing and burning
Not to burst anyone's bubble, but GME is artificially inflated right now
Yeah, we know
Here’s the WSBs list to BUY
EVERYONE listen up
Power to the People
If you’re from AUS, NZ or the UK  and want to BOARD THIS ROCKET 🚀 🚀 try using the app ‘STAKE’ to trade US stocks, I’ve found it to be the easiest to setup and and fastest to transfer funds, if you use the referral code mitchelli239, you’ll get a free stock, let’s help this thing keep rising baby 🚀 🚀 🚀  pm me if you have any questions about set up
Nobody use this scammer referral code, report spam, keep WSB clean
NOK is quite low right now 
TD is stopping me from buying AMC because they say the linit price is too aggressive
Robinhood is allowing to buy $SPCE
Don’t buy anything on robinhood, you’re now supporting a sleazy company who just manipulated the market for hedge funds
Sure, we may have lost money, but this is for the bigger cause
Many generations from now, we will be the founding fathers and mothers of modern finance, and I'm glad to hold a receipt to show the future generation that WE were the reason why the capital market is in good hands
Legal means dude, this is key
Just came here to tell everyone I logged into RH and saw GME was gone
Do you think we dont know that
What trader should I go with now
Yeah DO NOT BLOW YOUR RENT OR BILL MONEY
Like ive said before HOLDING GME since Monday
Why can’t i see the upvote on the post 
I'm holding my 1
Any reason I can’t buy anymore $GME on RH
Hold BB GME AMC
I’m bleeding 🩸
Citadel is a hedge fund that owns Melvin Capital Management
Melvin is a $GME short seller predicted to lose BILLIONS due to the people taking the free market back
Citadel owns the app Robinhood
Citadel banned purchases of new $GME shares on RH
Market manipulation
How can I join the fight if I have zero understanding
The good old Streisand effect
I want to write this comment here to know, maybe 10 later, that I was here, with all these lovely people's from all around the worlds
Cheers future me

Hey everybody these hedgefunds are losing money
We have got to create a platform to discuss in private
How can I get on the new gravey train I only have if I squeeze everything I got maybe $1000 how can I get in to help me get ahead working 40 paycheck to paycheck
Life sucks but I will never give up
SLV is owned by JPMorgan who is known for silver suppression
Occidental Petroleum coming back to play it’s going to be $100 , $150 and 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀😏🚀🚀
Should read *illegitimately
Good to go on WeBull
Everyone on robinhood that has no other trading platform should flood $SPCE
Still waiting
I’m still unable to buy GME, BB, and NOK
I’m not so sure
Regardless of whether or not robinhood switches buying back on, I will be moving brokerages after the $GME play is done
Everyone here knows that GameStop is not a good stock in actuality(Though its recent growth makes it a good buy actually
That’s a pretty brain dead take
Yeah, I know
I was motivated to invest by all of this so I took my savings account I want to use to buy a house in 2 years and I bet it all on VBTLX
Put it in the S&P 500
Ya I have a lot of s&p 500 in my longer dwell accounts
Oh yeah, I did not read the 2 years part
Congrats I guess
Yesssss
It moves quickly on TD but they haven't blocked that I've seen
They are manipulating the ask price so that it's not in line with the actual stock price
Remember wire that money to them
Dont forget to wire that money to them so its quicker to get on the brokerage
Just bought another 300 shares of $NOK
This 100%

Big tech censoring

Etoro doesn't have AMC but you can get all others
After this is done, I'm leaving RobinHood for WeBull
Someone tell me how much to put where lol
You have to set limits
Just put down on NOK
Yup
A do nothing deplorable degenerate
Make sure to set limits so you can sell in time
Its a scam
You have to make that choice yourself, what people are doing here might be illegal which is why some places have halted the trade of those stocks
ITS NOT ABOUT THE MONEY ITS ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE
Oh my gourd
They definitely didn't handle communication well but to their defense, the clearinghouse needs 2 days to clear with $ set aside per trade as collateral
I’ve tried to get the word out to you Robinhooders,  check your term agreements
When I was raising hell with my broker he calmly showed me in my contract where I signed that right away
I just found this on another sub reddit and wondering if u guys think it is legit
Buying back open on RH
I am already all in on nok
So all of the stocks are crashing
Cashapp working BTW
POST THE LINK TO THE TWEET SO WE CAN LIKE AND SHARE RETARD
Hit back at Robinhood
To get the free stock option you have to invite friends, who then have to open an account, and link their bank account to Robinhood
Never invested in stocks before but have a little money put aside
Is it worth jumping on the band wagon or am I too late to the party
Guys can I still get on this 
If I invest a couple hundred will I get any reasonable returns
Use cash app my people
Please spread this word
I have decided this sub is like the MAGA of investment
Sir this is a casino
Just write, "I'm a 🌈🐻", it's faster
Yes, please ban me and increase the echo effect of this particular chamber
I’m happy they are hiding it cause what you guys are doing is Fraud
This won't end well guys
Streisand effect in work
I can’t find tootsie roll either
And blackberry
Koss is gone from search as well
Eceleb TARDS, WE RIDE
Someone less dumb please enlighten me
The Streisand effect at its finest
Cant buy search GME on Cash app either now
Accounts could always be transitioned over to other companies
I don't see gme
Oh sorry
I saw AMC but no GME
What does that even mean
Buy how exactly
We love the STREISAND EFFECT
Too bad these Faze clowns are all pussies
Fools now we can just buy the dip as soon as it opens
Puts on Robinhood

KOSS as well
I'm going to the atm right meow
I just got RH asking questions to build a profile of me before I buy stonks

Looks like I can submit a buy for nok on Interactive Brokers
I like this stock

Also Bed Bath and Beyond
BUY WHAT DUDE EVERYTHING IS BLOCKED
I put an order in last night and yave the order confirmation but nothing in portfolio
TO THE MOON TO MARS TO SATURN TO PLUTO
I have it at 5
LETS GOOOOOO
Seriously this isn't cool
Does anyone know of another app that allows partial shares
I cant find it on cashapp as well
LETS GOOOOOOO
Ayo what should I buy and where can I do that
They are doing this because they know the general public thats been joining in with you guys recently will panic and give up
Cash app works for both AMC and NOK
God it went up to 500 and now its 250-270 because a lot of brokers blocked these stocks to be able to be purchased by the users
But the dip if you can
BB is still around
I smell fear
How do I buy more if RH is blocking the stock
RH just cancelled my queued order from yesterday
HOLD BOYS WE ARE TAKING OFF
Can’t buy BB on Schwab
It’s support but support from banks isn’t the best
Moving all my money to WeBull
Suspended on webull also
There one moment, gone
HOLLLLLLDDDDD
Don't poke the diamond clawed bear 💎✊🐻✊💎
THEY CANT HOLD US LIKE WE HOLD OUR GAINS
They're still visible on stash
Robinhood is down
Bring out the pitchforks and torches
Pluto
I had an order  queued for gme and they canceled it 2 minutes before market opened
How can someone buy GME stock if it's hidden from search
Noticed this happening real time
Dude
Beast too
They better not cancel my NOK buy order
EDIT: It went through
Anyone else can’t withdraw their money from Robinhood
They removed all the meme stonks from the top movers section at 9:20am and at that point, searching through the search bar produced nothing
Unless you currently hold a stock with these companies you cant see them
HOLDHOLDHOLD
They canceled all pending orders right before open too
I JUST LOOKED
On what though
If you wanna see it on Robinhood but you don’t own shares, you have to look at the trending page
It also looks like I can not buy bb either
We can’t even buy GME on RH now, not allowed
Smooth brain here, got a bit I don't mind losing
Get your money out of there and go to Fidelity
Let's get "Nottingham" trending
E
Toro down
WHERE CAN I BUY GME
The market is halted as well $300 not moving at open
Buying more out of spite
How about BB 
Imagine being named "Robinhood" and you do this
Robinhood restricted buying the stocks only selling is available, how is this NOT manipulating
What’s the plays boys
Big boys are scared
So where else can we buy
I scheduled buys on GMC, AMC, NOK, and BB through Robinhood last night
Your account is one day old
But how do we buy if our brokers block them
ITS OFF THE ROBINHOOD MARKET NOW
Anyone who didn't see Robinhood as an incompetent second-rate broker years ago should have been paying attention
They shut down buying options on ROBINHOOD
WHALES LETS GOO
Still holding 💎👐
All of my scheduled trades at open got canceled by Robinhood
All my brokers are down
BB is banned from the hood too
So the CEO guy went to press yesterday and portrayed himself as a warrior for small investors and came back and is taking small investors for hostage
Where can I buy
We need to hold 
How do I buy from India 
Talking about GME here
Unleash the KRAKEN
Tasty works supports us
We’re scrambling to invest in Hedi Klum’s underwear line now
I like the stock
My AMC order was cancelled, they said I cancelled it, I did not
Schwab won't let me buy either
Robinhood just canceled my GME buy
BBBY is also banned
In what should I invest, im a newcomer and eager to learn
Hate when reddit won’t let you delete a comment
GUESS IM ALL IN
True, if it isn't in your watchlist, they do not show up in search
HOW CAN I BUY
Yeah wtf, my order was canceled 9 mimutes ago
RH just cancelled all my orders from yesterday for AMC, GME, and NOK
I'm never selling
I LIKE THE STOCK
Time to hit $BB then
BURN THE WHOLE THING DOWN
Robinhood cancelled my AMC and BB trades that were lined up for open at 6:27 AM
They suck
Revolut declined my buying orders on bb and gme😏
Is there a way for us to buy more GME
Even worse they are only allowing sells so they kill the stock and then force you to sell it low
They might have locked out my ability to buy more, but I'm not selling
WE LIKE THE STOCK
I’m just a retard, how do I buy without robinhood
You can only sell AMC this morning but can’t buy AMC
German Stock market won't even allow to buy/sell gme right now
EDIT: They're pretending to have "technical issues"
Oh man i wish i could buy some but russia doesn't seem to have options to do so :(
Just got more GME on Webull
If that's the case
I can't even buy anymore wtf
I JUST BOUGHT NOK NOW DO YOUR PART INTERNET
Now I wish I had pulled my money from Robinhood sooner rather than later
Banks is a scumbag, look up what happened at Barley house and faze in general
Hold hold hold
This sounds ILLEGAL
THEY'RE ONLY LETTING US SELL
Main Street vs Wall Street
This smells like The Social Network
AND, they canceled my NOK buy
Give it time and refresh
I like how td ameritrade pricing is less than yahoo financing pricing
Robinhood needs to get sued for their platform literally not being able to work for 10 minutes into the open
LOL even FAZE BANKS is with us, who would have thought
Now when FaZe Banks is the voice of reason
Thank God I bought some NOK last night
I put a $1k order in last night (I know, small) and this morning Robinhood canceled my order and now they say the stock is not supported by Robinhood
Buy when it dips and hold
Robinhood may as well stop me from selling too
I don’t have $GME the results anymore
I mean isnt THIS market manipulation
It's like a street fight
READ THE DD'S
Isn't it interesting that no one on CNBC is talking about the Gamma Squeeze
Make sure you know the Short Squeeze hasn't even begun
Another Gamma Squeeze still coming on Friday
I'm not an advisor but I LOVE this STONK
Melvin has unlimited loss potential on GME
They got themselves into an infinite loss scenario doing illegal things because they got greedy and now all we have to do to LITERALLY NAME OUR PRICE is hold shares and not sell and they are forced to give us money infinitely, government bailout and all
HOLDING UNTIL $69420
Robinhood cancelled my orders on BB and AMC placed overnight with no explanation
They cancelled all my buys
I can’t even log in today
Webull blocked this too
This is an obamanation
Why they did not restrict NAKED SHORT SELLING
They aren't letting us buy more :(
TOS can still buy 
Too bad I only have Robinhood and it will take 1-2 days before any other platform will approve my account
Hella poor so wont be gaining but at least i can enjoy some memes and billionaires stressing
IM NOT SELLING BOYS
I just tried searching for GME in RH and nothing this is absolutely crazy
These CHEATERS still can’t hold down GME
So I mean if you have options in any of these expiring tomorrow you just lost THOUSANDS
How is this legal
Thousands of dollars for ppl just wiped out, and NOT in a normal market way
Let me buy tendies robinhood
Arent they sponsored by cashapp
I noticed I bought some Naked today, and now it suddenly says not supported
No kidding I was putting $600 into GME but that got cancelled
Hell yeah
I wanted to buy stonks 🥺
Robinhood marketed themselves as the platform for "the little guy" but they sold trade info to the big guys from day one, which is legal
I have no idea what happening but I have a ton of disposable income, what do I buy to create the most havoc
My BB purchase was canceled on rh
I tried getting a little bit of AMC and NOK last night and they canceled my orders just now
How can I even buy
HOLD
Fidelity not making it easy to buy
I can't find BB either
Taking all my cash out of rh and going to webull
Streisand effect
I don't understand who's buying these options if Robinhood isn't allowing anyone to buy
Is Robinhood buying them and writing options to outside investors
Arbitrage is common for traders
EVERYONE HOLD
I have a theory, what if all these platforms are halting buying the stock because they anticipate the squeeze happening soon
DDoS attacks on free trading forums and possibly reddit over the last couple of days
Run it up
Cashapp seems to be hiding GME too, anywhere I can buy more
GME is still game
TD is struggling this morning to run again
WE LIKE THE STOCK
Democratizing the market my arse smh
Cash App has also blocked the stocks as well
They were also hiding CCL this morning
Thinking I discontinue using Robinhood because they're not letting me invest in what I want to invest in
Pricks cancled my AMC buys on me this morning
Never thought i'd agree with Banks about something like this
I ordered amc 10 hours ago and they canceled my just now
My Canadian trading platform (RBC DIRECT INVESTMENTS) has been down every morning this week
For anyone who doesn't realize by now, this is how big banks make money
BUT IT IS NOT UNBREAKABLE
Worst comes to worst, we'll form our own brokerage
WALLSTREETBETS BROKERS
BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE
Is there a broker that is allowing us to still buy Reddit stocks 
Was able to buy GME on Vanguard
Afford to lose
Yeah this is totally sustainable and 90% of people won't lose their money
RH canceled all my orders placed for GME last night
I bought a share last night (yeah I'm a plebe) and this am I noticed it was "not supported" but said I owned the share
Their bs manipulation premarket only lasted 10 min til gme was back positive
Also International Brokers (IB) won't allow purchasing $GME anymore
What wall street doesn't grasp yet is that these things will drive people into other monetary systems that they cannot control
They don't know yet, what they have started here
I just jumped on the crazy train
I put in my orders after hours and now I don’t have any stock in anything after they canceled all my orders and blocked the stocks
Hey folks, just downloaded webull to navigate around this cluster and it appears gme among others are suspended there too
Webull is suspending GME, AMC and Naked I cant buy
Removed the option to buy anymore too
THEY CANCELLED MY ORDERS FROM YESTERDAY
Wild I thought it was just me
Yep made an order at 4am just fine, hour before the market opened they shifted it to "not currently supported by robinhood" then cancelled my orders right when it opened
Where can I buy every platform I am on has stopped trading on all these
I would encourage everyone to document evidence of these items and submit formal complaints to Robinhood and your state and federal authorities
Oh more than hiding them, they cancelled any orders for them and said that they cant be bought and sold on robinhood anymore
Is this why I can’t add money to my Robinhood account right now
Streisand effect in live time
Jokes on them I don't have cash to lose and still buying 🤪🙃
Robbin' the hood
Gross
Robbinhood cancelled my orders for GME and AMC, wtf
I did what I could on Revolut boys
Dude
And my $USD still isn't available to withdraw they are just holding my $USD hostage
Internet is undefeated
First time posting here
Just bought 23 shares at 330
And I’m going to HOLD
Schwab is not letting GME trades take place
I don’t know the legalities around this, but it sure as hell seems criminal
Power to the people {in banes voice} robbinghood must be punished for there actions
NOKIA NOKIA
My local broker keeps cancelling my GME order
Bad move rH
Market manipulation
Fidelity is blocking all market orders on GME, AMC, and BB
That seems illegal
They’re so lucky we can’t buy right now
Zenabis
Can still buy in the Public app
STAKE is down at the moment, either deliberately or groaning under the load
How are people gonna buy now
I'm in the EU so can't trade options but decided to do my bit and buy GME stock, but Revolut has cancelled all my orders and same with others I've been chatting to
DO NOT SELL
They cancelled my purchases I made today on NOK and AMC but my other ones went through
I was able to buy stocks on ETrade and just brought AMC 5 shares but thats all I could afford today
So I'm not an investor
How can Robinhood legally do this
How do I buy when Robinhood can’t even search it
Doesn’t show up in my Stash account either
Wish I could upvote a thousand times
I just watched hundreds dissappear before me eyes to protect me from hundreds dissappearing before my eyes, as if a 29 year old man needs protection
Wells fargo you heard it here first
Buy Buy Buy
I was able to buy on Vanguard I LOVE THESE STOCKS
The future is now, old men
So if I’ve got my stock on Robinhood, do i hold
THEIR NAME IS ROBIN HOOD remember how ironic this is
I can't buy or sell SNDL either
Robinhood is fixed
So weird
How do I buy now
RH 1
I decided to try but figured I was too late for the GME train
I cant even go to the moon
Don’t you know
AMC needs to dip more so I can buy more
Buying for you ✊🏻
For the record, ETrade has been rather steady in all of this
Use Webull guys
TD Ameritrade allow GME to be Sell ONLY at $50 below market price , unless you are willing to buy at $9999 per share
They cancelled my buy in to Nokia as well
I signed up for RH lastnight to buy some GME
Seriously how do I buy now
Im impressed
Got a note that Robinhood cancelled my order and now the website is having loading issues
Good tweet tho i like the stocks 🚀🚀🚀
Stash still got it
GME BABY WE’RE IN
Where can GME be bought now
Schwab blocking due to error = symbol is not valid
Corruption
They didn't just hide it
I just bought through TD, though they were not showing today's chart, and popped up warnings about margin limits being enforced on it
I want  to buy #GME but can't anywhere
I've been a observer on the GME front, but when I saw RH restricted things this morning
When this is over I'm definitely pulling my money out of robinhood and moving to an actual brokerage
I'm downloading Webull to drop 500 bucks, just because of this blatant manipulation
PUMP SUNDIAL
If you can't buy on Robinhood that makes the stock harder to get generally, right
Robinhood won’t let me buy more GME
They actually put out a statement, they blocked about 8 stocks from being bought at all
I can’t afford to lose any, for me 50$ is the difference between rent and no rent this month 🥲 fight on for me boys
Trade republic in Germany the same
Does this mean BB isn't a buy
So glad I never bought into the Robinhood hype
Please rate robinhood app on the app store
Never comment on anything, didnt even have an account until recently but Im speaking up now
This is the way
I got all my shares canceled last night on Robin hood
But what platform can I use to buy
Don’t mind me, just here so that more people get to see this
I bought $200 GME last evening and I get an email this morning saying my order is canceled
Yep, when I search GME in RH it doesn't show up, but on Schwab it is still there
NOK to the moon
No, prices go up when there are more buyers than sellers
You're thinking of a sell restriction
Robinhood locked my positions and does not support the stick anymore
WealthSimple in Canada is just giving people a warning
How can you buy in Robinhood
WE ARE IN THE ENDGAME 🙌💎🚀🚀🚀🚀
I only have $1400 more I can contribute but I'm in
Yo I’m losing hope in WSB If this the case
WTF
TD IS BACK ONLINE IN CANADA, IT IS ALLOWING YOU TO PURCHASE
Robinhood won’t let me buy more of the stonks
From the UK, can I help
They just canceled my limit sell at $10000
How does a 🐒 like me get in, all the online traders are blocking the stock and/or new traders
Literally can't buy they canceled my orders
They blocked purchases for $CTRM
My Charles Schwab account is doing the same for GME
So flood Robin Hood with calls and negative reviews for this blatant market manipulation
When you fight the internet, the internet wins
Also they hid bbby and in the last 30 seconds removed the option to buy
AMC IS FALLING GME IS UP
I'm just trying to look at the price man
How am I supposed to buy in if they’re getting banned everywhere
Has RobinHood given a statement on this yet
WTF, even my Ally financial is showing that its down
I do love how this whole thing is now involving everyone from politicians on both sides to esports gamers
Can RH block our limit sells in the 1k, 2k upward range
Robinhood cancelled my order for both AMC and GME
FIDELITY too
They (Robinhood) are canceling my orders from yesterday
Fidelity works
Is there anywhere we can buy
GME to Uranus
Use WeBull to buy more GME guys
This is gonna backfire hard 
ALL IN ON NOK
Wish I could afford to help in this fight
I started a switch to webull after robinhood pulled its shennanigans
I wanted to hop on Robinhood and help the cause by throwing all my disposable cash into GME and now I can't even search it
Thank you for that sweet sweet dip 🤚🧻
I can't buy
What’s the play today
They completely removed BlackBerry as well
Switch to Webull or join the $SLV gang (not blocked on RH)
More like robbin’ the hood, amirite
Woohoo
LET’S GO GME GANG WE CAN DO THIS
Oh these are the market forces I’ve heard so much of
Yup, I had an AMC purchase already scheduled for this morning
I'll buy in at $420
Is $AAL in play :) it’s going up
Where can we still buy gme shares
Thank God I was just able to buy 4 more GME shares on ThinkOrSwim
Move to Webull
Storm Wall Street
I am NEVER dealing with robinhood again
I'm on the same boat
Let's gooooooooo
I hope they get demolished
Streisand Effect
Robinhood app suddenly won't allow screenshots to be taken
So we can’t open options great
Since the market opened Ally is hiding my accounts
I'm locked out of both RH and etrade rn
Since RH and ToS restricted trading, what are you guys buying through
I just bought NOK and my td account all of a sudden stopped working for log in on my cell phone
BB not mentioned, that means buuuuuy
Robin hood canceled my order
After this, y’all need to take your money out of Robinhood
Don't forget SNDL
Did I invest in the wrong AMC stock then
Butthole clenching watching NOK
TD Ameritrade and Fidelity open account pages are legit crashing - can't even get through to open a trading account
Ok so I bought 4 shares of AMC last night on Robinhood, and this morning it said I cancelled my order which I didn't cancel at all
Stash blocked users out of their accounts
Real talk, RH canceled my orders, is there another brokerage app that I can open and start buying
Not to mention the ameritrade froze on opening this morning
Etrade still working I bough nok and bb today with my spare money
Blocking certain stocks from being traded is definitely market manipulation
My RH order of AMC from 2 days ago was just canceled
Next thing you know, they’ll come after this subreddit and shut it down
I'm a small, small fish, but even guppies can get sent into space as an experiment
I sent a sell order on my 1
But now that order is still stuck in pending and apparently I'm locked out of buying NOK
All I'm taking away is that $BBBY is still up
Are we still holding on AMC tho
Ameritrade I can’t even log in on
Placed an AMC order last night, got canceled this morning and now says AMC is no longer supported on Robinhood
TAKE ME TOOOOO THE MOOON
Where can we buy IN THE U
K
I'm having the same problem with Ally
Robinhood blocked purchases of GME just now
When I’m looking at rh app it says that I canceled the orders
No one forget what RobinHood did
Why are purchases not being allowed
Schwab looks like it’s working
Hold da line
Can I use e-trade to buy amc and GameStop
It's time to leave Robinhood
SPCE
When you are in Canada and use Wealthsimple so it’s not hidden
They literally cancelled my buy I made at 4am
I got 28 shares of AMC, trying hard to get the cash for more, i want to ride to the moon with you all 
Anyone know what happens to my Nokia shares now
Done
Only bet left is to buy BB at an exponential rate - BUY AND HOLD boys
What's the move
Fossil isn't blocked on Robinhood
Where can I buy if not on robinhood
Had moved in $100 last night waiting for the open this morning
Where can I buy stock in AMC and GME since Robinhood hid them
Speechless that this is OK
I'm sorry if this is a retarded question, but why is anyone saying "only play with what you can afford to lose" if there is theoretically no way for the retail investor to lose in this instance
What broker should I switch to
Robinhood no longer supports GME
Is fidelity still letting you buy
Left 1* review for the pos app and heading elsewhere
I was able to put an order through on Weibo
This legitimately seems like something you could sue Robinhood before the SEC for
This is whack
I woke up to cancelled orders for GME and AMC
Thrillin morning hoping that Wealthsimple didn’t do the same
Yeah wtf my NOK is hitting a hard ceiling
They literally just tried putting the fire out with gasoline
Took all of my shares, sold them and bought 1300 dollars of GME, this better work or I will cry
Any suggestions for a different app
I CANCELLED MY LIMIT ORDER FOR $400
I searched it last night and placed an order to buy for this morning
TIL - Robinhood app is nothing like the real Robinhood
Seeing AMC stock go down now, is this why
Go to Public
How can I buy in gme rn if I can’t BUY GME RN
Can this be finally the moment both the left and right unite against the establishment and find common ground
So as an unexperienced trader, I put in for shares yesterday after market close and now Robinhood is allowing closing transactions only; what's the end result going to be
They’re going to cancel, they canceled mine like 5 mins ago
BUY AS MUCH GME - BB - AMC as you can and show them they don't own us
RBC in canada is literally DOWN this morning
What do I use
Its now sell only, they have just ended themselves as we now know who they are for
Streissand effect
Schwab has hidden cost basis for these tickers on my account
I’d love to buy but I can’t
Anyone that uses robinhood should continue to use it, right up to the week before their IPO and then cash out and jump ship
It sure doesn’t seem like it should be legal to disallow purchasing of a publicly traded company
I can’t even find BlackBerry
Sucks that I can't buy with Nordnet
I’m canceling my Robinhood account :)
I can get GME and AMC on E*Trade just fine
Retards vs Evil
I've been lurking for a long time and I wanna jump in the rocket while I still can
Good to know, thanks
Ride the waves baby 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

INTERESTED IN PUMPING ALT COINS
The fat cats of wall street are fanning the flames of their own house fires, they could have just let the garbage can burn itself out and it would have been an acceptable loss, but instead they poured oil on it
Lets send $AAL to the moon
Leave reviews on App Store, force Google and Apple to remove the app from their own stores, and let their company drown
Someone explain to me why they're doing this in simple words
I can still trade on Vanguard

Robinhood cancelled my order for NOK at 9:27 and the message says I cancelled it,  but I didn’t
It’s gonna be occupy Wall Street 2
All in BB AMC NOK
This guy legit went on video yesterday talking about empowerment and the opportunities his platform provides
E trade users rise up
WeBull is having a gateway error when you try to transfer accounts now
Vanguard is allowing
I'm 20% down on NOK, but I'm presuming you autists are gonna make it moon right
I can't even get on my broker account to support the cause
Now that is market manipulation
Ah well
WEBULL on the App Store
Why do you people not use something like Futu
Interactive Brokers won't allow buying options on GME, AMC, and a few others
I'm not aware of any issues with E-Trade where I have another account, but I like keeping two brokers because of crap like this (usually margin changes on a particular security)
Amc network is available on robinhood BUY BUY BUY
Schwab has GME listed as invalid
Remove those 420
Schwab says symbol is invaild
Chase just executed my buy order
Stash too I have 3 out of 5 just pending when Disney and Tesla went straight to my account
On a normal day, I wouldn't consider exercising my call
So crazy
Why do we care about Faze Banks
It seems all the shorted stocks are restricted in Robinhoob right now
Sorry to say the US is no longer a free country
Puts on Robinhood
Tell me what to buy on Robin Hood
TD Ameritrade is pretty nice, makes me feel like cool hacks man
If anyone absolutely wants to buy GME(any meme stock since it seems like BB and AM-ç are suspended too) I can work out something through PayPal or zelle
I think based off my account history you'll be able to determine I'm not a scam
Reatard AMC rocket emoji to the moon
I get mine through Hargreaves Lansdowne, my purchase of NOK has been pending for the last 30mins
Where can I go to buy more GME
United we hold, divided we sell
They canceled my orders from NOK and BB last night
Is it still worth it to buy
WSB mods, please make a new forum , INVITE only with people who have made any posts since before last few weeks AND who have karma
So frustrated and tired of being manipulated
Anyone else have their $AMC orders cancelled and in the messages it says "You've canceled your order to buy X of AMC" when you didn't cancel it yourself
GME AT NEW HIGH
I just tried to log in and got error messages
YES, we need you now more than ever
Are significant gains still realistic at this point
If people buy and hold, yes
Nokia
Lmfao my son wants in now good job
They are even restricting me from YOLOing more money on SNDL
I can only see my CTRM on portfolio page
Don't give up on GME
This is an ant's life playing out in real life
I offload apps to save space
They are shorting all of the stocks that were popular on WSB this week
Ameritrade still allowing GME/NOK/BB/AMC purchases (if you can log in) BUY BOYS
I'm waiting for my money to transfer to E-Trade
I wonder if Robinhood could be brought to court over this
My bank posted a message this morning on their trading page essentially saying "The price we're showing you isn't what your trade is going to execute at
GME SOLDIERS SALUTE
They just restricted $SNDL
Honest question, this will probably be buried
If you already have GME shares or options on Robinhood, can you trade
Did Robinhood liquidate those positions to cash
Wow now it says that GME is not supported by Robin Hood
Honest question, this will probably be buried
So how do we find it on Robinhood now
Doesn’t seem communist *or* free to me
Any other tools I can use to grab some today if I don't already have an account elsewhere besides cashapp
How is this legal
THEYRE TRYING TO MAKE US FOLD
FINISH HIM
If you delete RH you can’t sell
Yay streisand effect
I can't buy GME anywhere but I'm in on NOK and AMC

I am clueless about the specifics on trading and only have a 401k, but I'm going to work toward learning now
Bought what little I could of AMC last night and woke up to it being cancelled
This definitely caused a considerable dip
Where can I buy GME
My order has been cancelled for reasons I’m uncertain of
Where we going next boys
Webull turned off comments
As someone who is new to stocks, where and how do I start
I threw $2000 in $AMC
I fully support this effort but I can't say it enough, stop using Robinhood; the app is letting a few other institutional funds see the transactions and front run them
Never bought with you bros before
I don't see why they wouldn't understand that preventing us from buying stocks we love would piss us off
They are there, but are “no longer supported on robinhood
They removed it from their app
On Cash
Was anyone else anticipating this
Can't even log into the Robinhood website to close my account
I wonder if I should buy in this FOMO hype
What should I buy
Can’t buy from Robinhood, WeBull, and CashApp anyone else 
You can still buy NOK on Cash App
Asia supporting the cause i got 3 shares at 264 on IG CFD at open
Can everyone PLEASE hold their AMC
It's like they've never heard of the Streisand effect
SPACE THE FINAL FRONTIER
BB's rise wasn't even insane, it was a good rise for a stock and they still blocked it
LET’S GO BABY
I don’t own any GME but the blatant corruption is just disrespectful
Anyone else having issues with webull
Is anybody having trouble buying on TD Ameritrade 
Blackberry not on the list
Switch over to Webull
Banks is filthy rich id like to take his money too
No problems on Webull
Use Webull if you have it
Etrade won’t let us create accounts
I logged into my Fidelity account just to see if I had a little money to play with and hardly anything is functional
I just bought AMCX is that not the same thing
Yahoo just saidbshares of GME plunged cuz of this
Guess what
Just use a real service like TD Ameritrade
Sundial just blocked
All of the money I could afford to spend is currently locked in Robinhood
Why is my E*TRADE ticker not keeping up
This makes me smile 
Can I set up a same day account anywhere just to piss in their cheerios
RH won’t let me buy BB
WeBull too
How do I buy more
Euro poor reporting for duty
Just bought 1 GME and 19 AMC we will make them hurt the same way they made us hurt
Total war
This is freaking market manipulation
Get into SNDL
No worries though
I have E*trade and I’m running that, but I have a little on Robinhood I wanted to play with
That’s also blocked
It soon will be
HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
I so wish I had more money to throw a gme
If FaZe Banks is saying to purchase something like this, do it
Anyway around this ban to find those stocks
Can't buy bb either
I put in a purchase order last night so that at the beginning of day I could buy some and it would not let me it says I can only sell my current shares
I can't even fund my Robinhood account, it errors out everytime I try to buy
What should I buy
Robinhood canceled my order to buy another share and now it says you cannot purchase more shares of this stock
Wanted to buy back into game today, now I can't, why are exchanges blocking buying gme stock
Buy NOK & AMC
Got my order canceled through Robinhood and tried cashapp and they won't go through
But market manipulation
File a complaint [sec complaint](https://www
Put in orders for gme and amc last night on rh
Can't stop, won't stop, GameStop
I like the stock
Is Schwab on record limiting buying
Yeah I tried to buy another $300 of GME last night and this morning they said I cancelled the order
This whole narrative of hiding stocks for "your own good" is patronizing and infuriating
SNDL is off robinhood now also
You can still buy through Stash app even though they will show a disclaimer that you are buying a volatile stock prior to purchase
They cancelled three of my orders, no explanation
SoFi still works
Where can I buy GME
Buy it somewhere else
Imagine what the internet can do to these platforms if everyone on WSB collectively closes their accounts on the same day
My NOK rocket got stranded in Texas
I can't even create an account with Robinhood
BB🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Buy what though
Why can’t redditors get a gf but they can crash the stock market
THEY ARE MANIPULATING THE MARKET
To show support for you weirdos I bought some amc and Nok- not enough to make a difference
Tried buying nok and game on open but robinhood cancelled then both and I can only sell my amc now
How else are y'all buying now
EDIT: Public has now also stopped buying of $GME (and $AMC)
Robinhood cancelled my orders wtf robinhood
Let's jump on BB 
You can buy on Merrill Lynch and Vanguard
Koss is gone too
What is a good place to buy from
Stash is “updating” or “experiencing a bug” haha
Last night i had a dream i was piloting a rocket ship, hurtling through space towards the GME share price
Around me was fire, in the distance a red stock counter which was rapidly counting upwards 1000, 2000, 3000
I tired to buy a share of AMC and they canceled it
EXPRESS gone as well
Bought some of these stocks last night and after open it still took an hour for my orders to be filled
My wife asked hpws my "stunks" doing today
What other broker has instant deposit so I can delete RH
I’m moving all of my $$ off Robinhood into less-corrupt brokerages
I guess it’s time to give Chinese Webull another chance
How do I buy if Robinhood won’t let me see it
I put in an order last night and it was canceled and I can no longer buy through RH
They are hiding EXPR now too
Pretty sure cashapp is hiding gme too
Switching to Fidelity
Yeah they straight up made gamestop unavailable on robinhood
Lets goooooooo
We the people
AMC is at a temporary dip, BUY MORE WHERE YOU CAN AND HOLD, DON’T PANIC SELL
Got some here in the states on Webull
I'd like to thank all of the boomers for their lack of pattern recognition and their extreme arrogance for fueling this rocket for us <3
The belong in Prison
Wtf, RH just dropped Sundial Growers too
Just bought on Merrill Lynch
ROBINHOOD CANCELLED MY ORDER THAT I PLACED LAST NIGHT AND SAID THAT I CANCELLED IT
What’s a good alternative to Robinhood
Problem they won’t let just buy robinhood and E*TRADE is now down
Bought one share of NOK , it was all I could afford
So much for the free market
Is
Yo, i put in a buy market order for 15 shares at open
This is it
Stand your ground brothers
Wow hiding it from search is next level sh\*t
You know who isnt limiting searches
Got into AMC, let's gooooo
I placed an order last night and it was cancelled this morning
They blocked buying on trading 212 for gme and amc
This is unreasonable
Thanks
Won’t let me buy any more
There’s a notification that says “this stock is not supported by Robinhood” for NOK, GME and AMD
Forget search, I can't even buy in a new position on GME with Robinhood
I loaded Fidelity on Android/ iOS apps, mobile browsers, 2 laptops and circle jerked my way around them until they allowed a BUY
Then rinsed, repeated
They tried to shut me out of NOK AMC GME
Holding
NOBODY SELL WE’RE TAKING THIS TO PLANET 11
I wonder if cancel culture can touch the %1
What's the best mobile trading platform
From Canada
This is not financial advice
This will only further disrupt them - organized chaos
I didn't want any but now that I cannot get any
Hold steady 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Tried to by aftermarket of AMC, they cancelled ny order
I'm new to this someone tell me a service to go through other than robin hood to buy
Every single time they attack retail retail just gets more ballsy and the stock soars
How dumb can Robinhood be
The SEC MUST going after Robinhood
Can you use a VPN to change your location and use different trading app
I will certainly not be using RH after this
The fact that they are able to do that is nuts
BB still safe
Where else can I buy GME
RAGE MY BROTHERS RAGE
I have 50k burning a hole in my pocket and know nothing about stocks except for all the hype I've been reading
WHERE can I buy some more at
They took down SNDL about 15 mins ago
Robinhood won't let you buy stocks in BB, NOK, GME, or AMC because they're, all of a sudden, "Not Supported"
Is this even legal
So as a complete amateur who's only ever used Robinhood, where could I get AMC stock now
I am willing to EMPTY my robinhood account into a new broker now
I’ve never messed with stocks in the past
STREISAND EFFECT IN FULL EFFECT
For those with time and motivation, and hopefully the more eloquent among us
Also, contact your senate reps
You can get NOK and BBBY on cash app
Go on etrade and buy 50k of GME lol
I wish I could buy more
I'm leaving Robinhood as soon as this is all over
I had nokia in my list and they suddenly show "this stock is not supported on robinhood"
Nevermind, I regret it all
So as someone new to this 
If I can’t buy on Robinhood
THIS IS WAR
GAMESTONK 🚀🚀🚀
As someone new here and someone who doesn't understand what is going on
Head on over to TD Ameritrade
Had to try like hell to get a buy in on Schwab this morning for AMC
So then they blatantly took the stocks, WHICH WE LIKE, off of the platform
Td has also halted trading on all the tickers being discussed here
I put down money for a share at 292 and they take it off the market lmao
I’m not very market savvy but this sounds like they’re trying to strong arm companies into blocking average folks from buying in which seems like a roundabout way of admitting that it’s not a fair market at all
It seems more apps are slowing their apps so people won’t buy
They removed $BB 😭😭😭
Puts on Robinhood 💀
I'm genuinely curious about something
Rocket tax: 🚀🚀🚀🚀
They stopped trading so you cannot see them
I can’t even sign up for robinhood :(
If anyone making the trades would like to benefit a dog needing surgery soon
God i was lonely trading for 3 years like a casual retard and I discover you guys when the boat has already sailed

Click Here to file a complaint wit with FINRA
Click Here to file a complaint with Robinhood directly
We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules "to protect" us
I think BB also block on there
They also did this with Tootsie Roll (TR)
Use etoro, etoro lets you buy
I purchased $4k worth of shares before RH could lock me out
Be Angry Be focused

Also AAL KOSS
Soon as that $100 gets in my stockpile acc I’m goin IN
Why is amc down :(
Etoro is also working
Hoped to buy the dip this morning before the 🚀 takes back off
I'm on Robinhood and it won't let me buy
Even BB has been hidden
In a Trump Administration this would be investigated by Congress & the SEC but in a Resident Asterisk admin, they'll never pay for this
Hold boys
Wells fargo is here next
I just noticed you can no longer purchase you can only sell GME and AMC
Just tried to buy addl and robinbood blocked, only available for sale, not purchase
WTF mate
They cancelled some of my overnight buys without reason and others still are on delay with no explaination
Robinhood says it does not support AMC now
Ally invest also shut down trading
We all need to join together and file a lawsuit against these brokers
The Streisand effect card has been played
So glad I bought into naked like a month ago because line went down and it was cheap
I cant even get on Td
I put my AMC order in last night
CAN I STILL BUY DECORATIVE GOURD FUTURES
It says 1
ROBINHOOD
Cant find in Robinhood
Say it with me: Bears r fuk
I’ve tried to invest in AMC and GME twice in the past 2 days using robins hood and my orders have been cancelled twice
Wow, Robinhood sold out to the Sheriff of Nottingham
Wow they “banned” GME
Oh wait
CHARLES SCHWAB DID THE SAME THING
ROBINHOOD CANCELED MY ORDER AT 8:26
My GME and AMC orders were canceled on Robinhood and now they don't show in a search
Also hid CTRM
Don't forget BB
Leave reviews on App Store, force Google and Apple to remove the app from their own stores, and let their company drown
You lucky duck
Let's go in OCGN, it is set up for next fight already
I will never sell, I will never surrender
They just cancelled my order this morning that I placed yesterday afternoon
Boycott Robinhood
Is it too late to jump on the wagon if I've never invested in stocks
Welp, robinhood just lost a customer
Schwab is also freezing all GME, AMC, buy and sell orders 💎🙌
I just have a measly 1
European retard here
If you can afford to, NEVER SELL
They refunded the $100 I funnelled into AMC and cancelled my stock order
They are blocking reviews on the App Store by the way
With people like FaZe Banks commenting on the matter this is going to be more and more public every minute
You can't even purchase $SNDL, which isn't even a part of this movement
Just confirming I opened a Fidelity account, set up a transfer and was able to buy GME and AMC
And now we short the hedge funds
I don't even know where to buy :(
Nvstr, Dough, Firstrade, Webull, Public, and SoFi
I sold 2k of ira on fidelity but they won't let me use to put into gamestop
We need to get Faze Banks a new avatar, yo

Leave a review of your experience
FaZe Banks is giving sound financial advice, and we thought 2020 was wild
Move your accounts from RH to some other platform
So many people are setting themselves up for an SEC investigation and they don't even realize it lmao
What's up with PRTY
Can anyone find $KOSS on their search bar in Robinhood
Send a direct message to robinhood by asking for "help"
What are some good alternatives
No you cannot
Forgot to mention, all you need to do is open an account with other brokers and tell them you want to move from RH and provide details
Webull just suspended gme wtf
Will hold until the sun dies out
I’m on Stockpile and it’s still visible
I’ve never done stocks
BUY GME, HOLD
Just bought £500 GME in my SIPP

Doesn't sound very Robinhood-like to me
I say we make them reconsider this
Bombardier is next
Even Charles Schwab was like that
Doubled my position in NOK today - I welcome the dip
It’s available on e-trade
Luckily TradeStation let me buy today
BOUGHT 1 SHARE ON A CASH ACCOUNT NO BORROWING AGAINST ME BOYS
How can i join this marvelous movement
To the mooooooon
Citadel Capital handles 60% of Robinhoods trades
Hold your position and request to transfer your stock to WEBULL or somewhere else, even TD Trade is better at this point
Funny how you can’t buy, but they let people sell
With all these distractions, BB is falling
Never thought I'd actually agree with anything Friar Banks says
Hell really has frozen over
I bought at open
If you go to most common traded stocks you can still find all of the ones we’re trading
Should I join you
Honestly - here's my philosophy
Should I join
Are yiu guys gonna be mad at me if I sell 40stocks at 500
Public mobile app has been working for me this morning, was able to add to both GME and AMC with no issues

Can I flip a quick buck from this
Fidelity finally let me through @ $417
To the moon
Trading 212 suspended buying for AMC this morning and only allowed selling
My parents lost our house in 2010

BB getting the spurs put to me but still holding
I'm holding to the moon meet you all there to chill comrades  🚀🚀🚀
I wan't to take this opportunity to thank every single person in this community
Wow Robin Hood cancelled my order for GME
How have none of these people heard of the Streisand Effect
I think people are selling to transfer funds over
I’m trying to but I accidentally sold my Robin Hood share and it wouldn’t let me cancel and Now I can’t make an account on any trading site
Bought 1 share at 369
Make sure retail investors can only sell
HOLD THE LINE
Cat is out of the bag
Alright alright alright, which apps are allowing trades with GME or the others
Webull isnt allowing ya to buy AMC or GME at that moment
No, we buy more at a discount
Was banned from Robinhood due to day trading while poor anyways during all this
Etoro has everything up 
If you missed your chance on GME, here's the train coming back around
Where should we buy it now since they removed it
How can I buy GME if Robinhood blocked it
I successfully bought GME this morning on Vanguard
My RH order for NOK and AMC just went through, but KOSS did not
I still hate Robinhood, but I placed a buy order for 2 shares of GME after market had closed yesterday and they fulfilled my order 15 minutes ago
Will monday be too late to buy in
FAZE CLAN

Mine just processed, did a quick test run
AAL gone now too
What trading app should I use now fellow soldiers 
Is this the official sub
Yeah I can't view or trade $GME
Have issues signing for Schwab 
This is error message I’m getting
They did the same to SNDL and CTRM
Hello folks, I created this page  r/takedownrobinhood to take this topic collectively serious at some point once we are in less volatile times to make sure that the Robinhood and other platforms pay for taking such outrageous and illegal actions against us
Just threw $1K at GME and AMC through Fidelity
Bb and amc too
You can still buy GME on Wealthsimple, dont know if this helps
GME BB AMC ARE BEING SHORTED YOU DROP YOU LOSE
So has Charles Schwab turned off transfers
On Etoro they keep closing the market and it keeps "glitching" and looking like it has tanked 70 percent but in actuality it's cruising upwards
Up in Canada wealth simple trade isn't
Robinhood won't let me buy more blackberry shares but will let me sell them
Any recommendations for apps to get into trading then
Robin hood is protecting the king
E*TRADE is now crashed
I buy on Stash for long term
Sndl
I created an account on RH and dropped in all my disposable income to buy GME this morning and now they won't let me
Transfered money to my trading account now but the money won't arrive before NYSE closes until tomorrow
No
E Trade has a error when I try to create an account
Cashapp illegally blocked GME but you can still do NOK and AMC
Your good bro I bought last night and they cancelled my order this morning so at the very worst you should get your money back
I know but I want to get in on this madness
So getting on tomorrow will probably be fine
Yes
I switched to Fidelity now so I can continue to buy stocks from AMC and GME
Shirts are winning on NOK
What if long holders exercised all their deep in the money calls
Pretty ironic of Robinhood - considering the story of Robinhood and all
I can only buy  minimum of 1 share through my broker, wich is to pricey for me
Koss and tootsie roll they stopped as well
Koss and tootsie roll they stopped as well
Makes me wish we could old school have someone on the floor representing us and tossing papers around screaming like in the movies
FIDELITY GUYS
Guess no one's buying $SNDL either
Transfer your shares to somewhere else
Holding on for dear life
Cash app NOK purchase has been pending all day
Was able to buy GME and AMC through Etrade account just now
CASH APP IS CANCELING ORDERS BUY SOMEWHERE ELSE
Robinhood blocked purchases of these stock also
Bought another share,total of 9 now because they pissed me off
Tried switching to Fidelity and transferring funds 
BB got hidden too
What else do the shorts have to throw at this
How do we buy if they hid it
Is it possible to get more people involved in this like global
Love Fidelity
Ameritrade webpage is hanging if you are trying to open a new account, I'm in the UK can you recommend a platform still trading GME anyone
Where can I move my money to from RH, where this kind of BS won't happen again
I guarantee this douche isn’t investing all the cash he can afford to lose
WE WILL BE DINING ON THE MOON SOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌝🌝🌝🌝🌚🌚🌝🌝🌝🌽🌽🌽🌽🧇🥓🧇🥩🥩🍔🍔🍖🍖🍗🍖🍟🍕🍟🍕🫓🥙
Get a different broker if they banned it
Melvin can fondle my balls
I put some of my meager monies in at $417
I bought a few Nokia shares last night only to wake up to see they refunded me it and now I can't buy it on robinhood anymore
Should have stopped using Robin hood a long time ago
I'm proud of all of you
Fidelity is the way to do it y'all
So I just bought some shares of AMC off cash app
IBKR IS GOOD 
Trading of GME, BB and others gets halted frequently, or sell-only
Got an order on limit in through Vanguard - I’m officially part of wsb
The dip
They also hid BB
I haven’t participated in this at all, but I just want to say you guys are doing great work
CashApp won't let me look up $GME either
ON SALE RIGHT NOW
Buy XRT, their fate is bound together
BB got hidden as well
Robinhood is also blocking $SNDL
Robinhood uses Citadel, so RH is a victim too
Tbh banks is not someone I would want on my side
Did robinhood freeze for anyone else
Don’t buy anything other than GME
GME or bust people , we must hold
This is completely illegal and constitutes market manipulation
Just picked up NOK on cashapp
I keep buying on DeGiro 🚀🚀🚀 even AMC
Faze banks is an idiot but his message is sound
NOK BABBBBBEEEE TO THE MOON
Cash App did that with GME
Same for black berry
What other platform can I use to buy
How are they allowing selling and no buying
I don't really like faze banks, I honestly think he's kinda a douche
Charles Scwabb is working, too
Can't even search Game stop now
I would if Robinhood hadn’t been holding up my cash infusion for days
Buy GME ONLY
They hid BB too
I think the SEC is in on it to try and decrease volatility and stop the frenzy
Fill out SEC complaints
We can’t buy, only sell, but yet they say a public Reddit thread is one guilty of manipulation
The unstoppable power of We The People on display, hit em hard where it hurts
Dont sell your RH position yet that is exactly what they want
This isn’t the first time Robinhood has manipulated the market
How long does it take for funds from your bank to be transfered to your Robin hood account
What other apps can I use
This too shall crash

R they gonna restrict them forever
It's ok, NOK tanked already
Yes this is the way

Very malicious
Robinhood canceled my order for 1 stock of GME, what do I do about that
What we do now 
Not TD here in Canada, been trying all morning
You will never be able to win against your owners using their tools
It’s open on stash
Upvote so it's not in the comments
How long will this block from Robin hood go on
Are you trying to buy shares on Fidelity and running into an error message
This is not financial advice, just technical internet help in case you have already decided to buy the stock for some weird reason
S
All they are doing is postponing their demise
Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post
About to buy 300 worth of amc
I didn't find any posts that meet the matching requirements for r/wallstreetbets
It might be OC, it might not
Feedback

HOLD THE LINE
Cash app is doing the same thing with GME
Well
If you're not buying fractional shares vanguard is still allowing you to buy in
But we can’t
Use [TDA](https://www
Someone needs to meme the Thanos meme with the RH logo
What about trading212 they blocked buying GME and AMC today morning in Europe
Ally Invest is down
Same with Cashapp
Stupid question

The establishment just tried to put out a fire with gasoline
Use revolut to buy stonks  (šo far the havent blocked GME, AMC
Just submitted to withdraw all my funds from Robbinghood
I can’t even search for little old XSPA
Supporting from Australia
They hid blockbuster also
They also cancelled my order from last night

So to recap the last 24 hours
All i know is they are scared of us

Am i too late to join this 🚀
Ok they cheated, but is it over
Heres what I wrote the SEC on my complaint against robinhood
This is Occupy^2
Of course not
This is Occupy^2

They now hid american airlines too what the heck is this
Only one working for me is vanguard right now
STREISAND EFFECT BABY
Is there anywhere that shows the short interest in realtime
GME is not on Schwab search anymore
Fidelity not allowing purchases
Im on jumped on fidelity even after losing money cause of robinhood stock manipulation
I'm so blown away at what's happening
No, use the app
EDIT - But they blocked trading on certain stocks
SoFi App is still running smooth
Vanguard works fine for me
SoFi is currently working for me
Banks a legit Clout God
Well
Ironic for a service called "Robin Hood"
Is it too late
Father Banks always representing
Father Banks always representing
ROBINHOOD = CITIDEL = KEN GRIFFIN
It's going back up boys
Really, this is the guy you want on your team
Where do I buy
The question is, is it too late to buy
Can anyone tell how to invest in the GME
Most stock sites have been hiding them since yesterday
Has anyone contacted their representatives
Because buying was impinged price was suppressed
Hop on WeBull 
Webull says they're stopping buying as well now, though they filled my limit buys at 145 on the way down earlier
Let Robin Hood know you’re pissed
Glad I already had 200 shares of Nokia
Ally invest halted trading on AMC
Revolut is literally doing the opposite lmao, the first 3 stocks it shows you are GME AMC and BB lmao
Can't buy anymore NOK either, not just GME or AMC
I hope the affected companies file a complaint as well
Retard here
Hey I know this thing, it's called the strisand effect
I'm new to investing
And they say banks isn't on our side
You can scroll the news ticker and find mention of GME and open from there
I can't even *find* GameStop on Robinhood anymore
I have been planning to switch to Robin Hood for over 2 years now
They can only control us because we use their currency
Etrade is working
I wish I could buy some and watch it go down so I'll just cheer you guys on from the sidelines
Anyone know if this is happening on Schwab too
Infuriating
First thing I did today is moved toward ditching Robinhood
Low kEY FACE BANKS IS A BTICH,
Anyone using Revolut
Where do you go to buy these stocks 
These cocksuclers need to take their lumps like big boy
How does this little idiot join in on this
I bought $50 in NOK on CashApp
How can I buy
It ain't much, but just bought 2 shares
What should I buy
They also stopped Sundial too
Love u banks
I want to know how many shares are shorted now
I can't wait to buy pluto with all this gme money
TradeRepublic also blocked buying, you can only sell now
So what brokerage apps are you guys using besides Webull that are not blocking trading or hiding companies from search
Well done if you bought the dip on GME today and doubled your money
They also hid Sundial (SNDL)
I don't have much money, I can probably afford 1 share, will it be worth it
Any advise for those late to the game that want to participate in sending $GME and $AMC TO THE MOON
What's the next move
How do I buy this now
If you can get in
Man this is just getting better and better
Don’t forget CTRM
For someone who is completely illiterate in the stock market but has $100 to invest can anyone give an ELI5 instructions
I was stoked to buy Robinhood stock when they IPOd
Was using a blocking statement I have never seen before, it was different from their standard one
Retard here
So did Cash app
Webull did the same thing
Can’t find BB on there anymore either
TDL please
This is amazing I've never really been interested in Wallstreet bets but honestly this is just hillarious to watch
Don’t forget $BB
We die on this hill⚔️
Salute our Indian brothers
Just bought AMC on Fidelity
Just bought some on etrade
Let’s buy RYCEY
All theyve done is made people aware of stocks that are being mooned
AMC bb and gme all open on E*TRADE
STASH app did the same exact thing
This a new one
This a new one
I'm a complete utter noob when it comes to stocks
Where to buy
AMCeeeerrr
Finally starting 2021 and the people are winning
It’s no coincidence that Dan Sundheim is a major investor in Robinhood and is his firm is *also* losing big on GME
Barbrastrisand
Yeah Faze Banks woukdnt be the rep I would want to put on the front page, he is the type who will say this but dump while everyone else holds to make a quick buck off of you
Can't even watch the stock realtime but you could about 2hrs ago
UK here - IG Trading Platform is working and $BB, $AMC, $NOK and $GME were all trading fine - just checked and $BB, $AMC, $NOK all able to "buy" but "sell" is grayed out
Ally
Search manipulation we need to hold the line boys
Where can I buy
Etrade
What if Robinhood was waiting for this moment, like This is the reason the app exists in the first place, just a security net for the hedgefunds that own it
There’s a guy who posted on this sub about a lawsuit against Robinhood
Remember they can cancel trading for traditional stonks but not for cryptos DOGE coin to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
What stock we jumpin on next
GME shows up now
Rh is tied to a billionaire capital firm that was losing money like all the rest of them and shut it down
The GME stock "is not supported on Robinhood" as of my checking just now
That's if you can even find it through the search function
You madlads and your rocket ship have so many people rooting for you
YES
It’s Alex Cabeceiras
I cant load the wsb subreddit, did someone take it down

The Streisand effect
Here to be a part of history
I don't have any single penny to spare, but my thoughts and prayers are with you, retards
I’m upvoting with my multiple accounts
And once you are able to, transfer all your shares to fidelity and close your RobinHood account
Does anyone know how to go about changing over all my positions from robinhood
Dude even him
You realize you’re making Blackrock rich, right
All of this has got me interested in becoming an investor
I can’t even upvote these posts
I'm just so proud of you all
Where to go to buy
Maybe-  but it’s going to make all other upset from this year
FWIW [Ally
Bread time
Can someone explain this pls
Stock market has always been a rich person thing that I didn't understand and never really cared about
This is not the first recent incident that should make you question if Robinhood is the right platform for you to use
If someone could explain to a very poor person that would love to stick it to the bigger corporations for once in their life, I’d love any advice/help
Seriously, as soon as I can buy I'm doubling what I planned on putting down
More or less correct
But why ban people from buying AAL too
Why invest in something the government doesn’t mind bailing out time and time again
As soon as they stop manipulating the market I am buying more
Ah man I guess we can only sell
So did E-Trade Power for a time
This is not the first, nor the last
So how can I jump on this train
Cash app allows buying NOK
How do i help with my $1000 and never traded before
Added 12 more
Little question I'm hoping someone see's and answers
How did Reddit know the hedge funds were shortselling GME stock
Isn't all trading secret
New to this, but really interested
Please all hold and keep this going
Wow glad faze clan is telling you guys how to gamble your money
As a primarily app based company they love app ratings
S
Take me to the moon Elon 🚀🚀
Can someone ELI5 wtf is going on with this entire situation
Hedge funds use more aggressive tactics like this to make a ton of money and it hurts the industry
So these madlads on WSB decides to buy A LOT of gamestop's stock, a company expected to fare very poorly
You can still buy AMC on Cashapp
Is AMC gonna be just as lucrative as GME though once this pans out
Can’t see the anger from the stock price at this moment
Can someone ELI5 why I should or should not buy my first stonk and make it GME
Doesn't sound very legitimate
I can not even buy the GME dip because tdameritrade haven't clear the funds from another position that I sold yesterday
It would just increase search volume for those stocks in particular with people asking why it isn't there lol wtf type strategy is that
I think something similar happened in 2008 if Melvin was the hedge funds or institutions
Im a brilliantly autistic retard and bought in via revolut 
Oh my god this is amazing

Sort of correct but to invest into a Hedge fund you need to be a millionaire so it's more like millions of millionaires use there collective wealth to then leverage against retards and autistics and rape/fix the market as they see fit
Brilliant people of this subreddit

You dont know how much meaning and hope your post gives us in this hard time of crime and injustice
Every army needs a king
IF HES IN , YOU'RE IN, I'M IN, EVERYBODY'S IN
Just bought 140 shares this evening
Why should only big money decide who gets to live and who goes down under
If it weren't for Tesla and the people who believed in it, when all the big hedge funds were trying for years to put it down under, who knows where we would've been today in EV tech and industry
GME, for better or worse, is waking people up to the realization that we, as individuals, still possess the same power as we always have: the power to unite, collaborate and structure ourselves around ideas in order to bring them to reality
People are starting to realize that not only can they affect change in their societies by the power of their vote, but they can also do it by the power of their wallet, regardless of its weight
Wealth inequality needs to be tackled at all levels of society, not just by policy
GME is a good company, with a solid investment thesis and more importantly, the potential to transition into something that our generation of gamers sorely needs
Save and transform
I'm sending a message, as I know you all are
Remember, change is a long game of attrition which will be won only by those who will endure its tides
I am not selling
Man I really needed to see this after today
HE DIDNT SELL A SINGLE SHARE
Edit : forgot you apes can’t read : 🚀🚀🚀🚀

BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL
OK ALL IS WELL

This man lost 14 million today, and reacts with nothing other than an update
I'm sure DFV knew it wouldn't all be green days
Losing more money in a single day than most people here will make in a lifetime
In 3 lifetimes I couldn't make what you lost today
SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE  Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME
Such an inspiration, not even joking
They’ll own homes, pay off student loans, medical bills, set up college funds, and be able to relax
My only regret is jumping in so late
I pray when all this is said and done, your lineage never has to work again
HE LIVES
WE ARE NOT LEAVING
HE’S STILL IN I’M STILL IN
HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
Ouch
My gf is mad/sad that we're in the negative after opening at almost 50% gain today
IF THEY CAN REMOVE THE BUY BUTTON, WHATS STOPPING THEM FROM REMOVING THE SELL BUTTON WHEN THE PRICE IS SKY HIGH
LEGENDARY STATUS UNLOCKED
DFV could have taken the $47 million yesterday and sold out to the sweet high life that the elites enjoy in secrecy with their hedge funds
But No
HE STILL IM
Ok should I be putting up 15k at 196

Watching a man become a legend in real time has been the highlight of my week
Yesterday I said I'd take my last 1k and buy pre-market
None of those other stocks give me the same feelings that GameStop does
NGL I was kinda freaking out today when it got close to 100
This should be the top comment
Why be angry when bigger gains await him
Oh no problem, they'll get it back big time tomorrow
The publicity this is gaining due to their dirty tricks today isn't helping them
And next week as well
Nah, he’s good
Dang dude I’m sad you aren’t in gme
This is the low tide before the Tsunami brother, this is the banks getting scared

Thank you sincerely
I can’t believe I am here for this
I love the internet when this type of stuff happens
I bought a tenth of a share the other day at 350 because that's all I could afford and I like the stock
I tried to buy @ 220 today
HE HAS SPOKEN
God amongst men

He who is wealthy in spirit, in heart, and in friends is already rich
You’re wonderful, I watched your videos and feel blessed that someone so deserving in the world would receive those returns
I got $53K waiting on them to pull the dirty tricks after hours and try to push down the stock again to $112 
Alone we are week like a single twig
You crazy tards actually held
I held today and was down like 85k
And then here you go, holding through an almost 15mil loss
You don't just have  💎🤚's
But is he holding tomorrow

The balls of steel on this man are a national treasure
You're our last hope against the machines
God, is that you

Tomorrow let's hit 10K
I was up 50k for the first time, saw it fall down to 20k
Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic
I wish I understood this more when it got started
You are pretty much the leader of the revolution at this point
If you are holding , I am holding to the very end of times 💎🙌🏻
WE RIDE AT DAWN

Aftermarket up by 63% and rising
Took all my gains out of Rh today yes I sold my options / RH sold my stocks for me

If they don't think we are going to 10k they are in for a surprise, take it all
Is $14
What a legend, we sell when he sells
That's what it's all about
He sacrificed 30+ million of his portfolio in the name of HOLDING
Is it still wise to buy any tomorrow at open
This feels like a new Independence Day
DFV, you will soon be the reason my whole life changes
You are a good person, and if I ever get to meet you I’d be honored to shake your hand and buy you a drink
IF DFV IS IN
I'm going to be honest, I jumped in to make a quick buck because the short squeeze seemed well reasoned
This post was the most silver awarded & awarded across all of Reddit on January 28th, 2021

So for someone who doesn’t know much besides the rabbit hole studying I’ve been doing all day, does it make sense to buy a AMC stock if I wanna just be apart to see what happens
I will be buried with my Gamestop stock and will be so rich in hell I'll be able to buy my way into heaven
I saw this
Take it as a sign
It's not to late, ya'll gotta hold and buy more and I gotta start buying and holding
You don’t even have an account and you’re an expert
I'm not an expert and this is not financial advice, I just like the stock
GME - total shares he has bought, 50k, of Gamestop
No problem
I will hold til I have nothing left to hold

You are a very good man
Thank you sir
Where did you buy
My cozy socks are on with your brother
Didn't he sell $13
He did not sell, what you are seeing is how much he lost in potential profits today due to the stock tanking
I'm talking about the Cash Total row
Oh my bad, I'm not sure tbh
Looks like he sold 13
Then what does the 13
Look at his post history
Financial aid refund drops tomorrow
You haven’t lost till you sell
That’s true, though one of my orders on GME and 3 on Bb hit their take loss yesterday and were closed

IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
This poor man
I am only but one useless 🦍 but I give you my permission to sneak a little profit here and there dude
I wish I knew what this meant
Just commenting to be part of history
Congrats on being the 3rd most upvoted post of 2021
Reddit recap says I'm one of the first to like this post
Just got goosebumps coming back to this post
This is history
Miss you legend
Can't stop, won't stop
Just bought 140 shares this evening
Thank you RK for your initial thesis, and for putting in the work to present a golden DD that showcases the reality of business and big finance in the US and around the world
Why should only big money decide who gets to live and who goes down under
If it weren't for Tesla and the people who believed in it, when all the big hedge funds were trying for years to put it down under, who knows where we would've been today in EV tech and industry
GME, for better or worse, is waking people up to the realization that we, as individuals, still possess the same power as we always have: the power to unite, collaborate and structure ourselves around ideas in order to bring them to reality
People are starting to realize that not only can they affect change in their societies by the power of their vote, but they can also do it by the power of their wallet, regardless of its weight
Wealth inequality needs to be tackled at all levels of society, not just by policy
GME is a good company, with a solid investment thesis and more importantly, the potential to transition into something that our generation of gamers sorely needs
Save and transform
I'm sending a message, as I know you all are
Remember, change is a long game of attrition which will be won only by those who will endure its tides
I am not selling
Take my award, I know you are out there
This post was flaired as a YOLO so it's on the YOLO list
OH, HE'S GOOD
AutoMod needs to check themselves
He sold 300 of the calls though
I admit, I panicked this morning and sold at 290
FORGIVE ME
Platinum, diamond, comet ore hands

Happy cake day
LOL I said the same thing years ago at the start of all of this
I'm trippin out coming back here after hiatus during the low market
AutoMod, you don't need to post on DFV's YOLO
He’s already profited from this by orders of magnitude
Word on the streets is that his balls are made out of vibrainium
I'm not caught up of DFV's manga, but I heard he turned $50k to multi millions
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
I hear boomer sobs
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
HE SOLD NOTHING
HE'S HOLDING
Having a difficult time holding
And I thought my $100k loss today was a tough blow

Anybody know if you can still request a printed certificate of ownership of a share of shock
At this stage I don’t want you to be my wife’s boyfriend
HES STILL IN
You can
I’m up to 19
Comment probably won’t make it through, but I just picked up 3 shares of GME to support the cause
Would someone be able to succinctly describe what's going on, why, and provide material for me to research on the subject
This is my favorite part of every day now
Like at the end of a battle, we stupid foot soldiers standing straight finally as the smoke clears and searching the haze for our king
Day after day DFV is there as it settles, covered in blood today, but still valiant and steady
His soldiers cheer out in resilience “IF HE’S STILL IN, WE’RE STILL IN
We all needed this
Thomas Peterffy, CM Interactive Brokers, just said short squeezing is ILLEGAL, and they CLOSED OUT POSITIONS FOR THEIR CLIENTS, most of which were SHORT
HOLD AND SQUEEZE 💎🫂💎
Power to the player
If he's still in, I'm still in
You are the hero of Reddit right now
He would be in the green if it weren't for Wallstreet interference
I have been staying away from GME all the time, while rooting for you, until today I saw the ugliness of the wall street, I finally bought 10 shares of GME
Where can I buy gme
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
When you’re down 15 million dollars but it doesn’t even matter 😂😂
Imagine if GameStop actually had any plans to innovate their business model after we've cuckholded citadel
WE LOVE THIS STOCK
I've lurked for so long, and just started commenting and posting more because this is the best subreddit I've ever joined
Edit: 💎👐🚀🚀🚀
You are almost guaranteed to be portrayed in film by an A-list celebrity within the next ten years
STRONG TOGETHER
Placed an order for a single share, that's all I can afford to lose
Wow, such a shining thing
I’M HOLDING
WE HOLD
I’ve been on Reddit almost 8 years and this is the most I’ve ever been engaged by the community
I really needed to see this today
If he's in, we're in
You forgot this king 👑
This man’s balls have their own gravitational pull
You’ve created a big moment in the stock market, internet, and gaming history 🙏
This man lost more money TODAY than most people will ever make in [almost 6 LIFETIMES](https://www
Just commenting to show support
This bro is Down $14m and people crying about dropping a few bucks in a day
I wish I'd got in this when I saw your first post, but I got in when I learned that this was now a movement
The tard king hath spoken
Look to my coming on the first light of the fifth day, at dawn look to the east

Barely managed to buy a portion of the stock, but I will hold all the same
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
Hold my brothers
The sun never sets on a King, it merely rotates around him 😤🙏
He really is ride or die
We hold at dawn
If he’s still in I’m in 🙌
I’m just commenting so I can be a small part of this man’s legacy
Holding
Working for Robinhood is gonna be as good for your resume as being an accountant at Enron
The calm before the storm
There is some legit analysis that could play out for GME beyond this craziness
Whether you have 0
Hold the line men
IF HE'S STILL IN, IM STILL IN
Legend has it that his balls are so large that they exist outside of time and space, because otherwise they would crush the entire universe
WE BLED A LITTLE TODAY, BUT TMRW WE BUY AND SET OFF TO THE MOON
CANT STOP WONT STOP GAME STOP 💎💎💎💎
If he can lose 11 mil I can lose more than 1k
This is very good news, no
My guess is they used today to short more
Face ripper tomorrow
HE WILL BE PORTRAYED BY BENEFIT STOCKRICH
Hell yeah brother we will return for our 300s comrades, just hold on
No gamernaut left behind
Who else bought the dip 💎💎
This isn't even his final form
Today we saw some retards become more powerful than the emperor of hedge funds
STOP GIVING AWARDS AND SAVE IT FOR GME
I am in awe
Obviously expecting this to go over $480 again
You are an absolute legend
HOLDERS OF WSB
There may be a day when diamond hands turn to paper at the sight of blatant market manipulations caused by investment funds
HOLD NOW
BUY MORE GME
HOLD FOR TENDIES AND THE END OF MELVIN CAPITAL AND FIDELITY
If he’s in, **I’M IN**
He’s in, I’m in
THIS WEEKEND: transfer all of your shares and money out of Robinhood and into a different broker, but do NOT sell
IF HES IN, IM IN
So basically they just manipulated the market to steal 14 million dollars from someone
We like GameStop, I bought my first N64 here
You sir are a legend
I wonder if Leonardo Di Caprio is going to portray you in the movie "WallStreetBets"
I could only afford ONE SHARE at $300
Look to the east and behold
This post is the reason it went up after-hours 💪
The show goes on
Can I purchase the film rights to tell your story
He IS the messiah
I tried to explain to my wife why I wasn't selling, this is why
I still have my 300 shares
If he can hold why can’t we

Enjoy the big leagues, ya phenom

I Choked
I got in at $289
I had $180 left in the trade account - I didn't pull the trigger when it was at $120, because I was being a chump
What stock are we buying and when so I know when to make some dough
R
A god of our race of humans
I LOVE THIS STOCK
I LOVE YOU
What brokerage is he using
What will tomorrow bring
If he's still in I'm still in
GAIN PORN COMBINED WITH LOSS PORN, I CAN ONLY CUM SO HAAAAAARD
I’m new to investing, but I’d die for this man
I love you man
No homo
There should be an actual religion established for you, if only for tax haven purposes
Ok people need to STOP spending money on coins and awards for this, and instead PUT THAT CASH INTO GME
We will forever be grateful to our king DFV
LOOK AT THIS RETARD
Makes me happy to be apart of this, even with my life in shambles
Now THIS is loss porn
Still holding

This post is what sends us to the moon 😭 on our worst days, deepf***ingvalue is our beacon of light
I have nothing to hold, but i gotta say
Wtf 
I feel like holding is more than just a meme now this is a protest, this is how we fight the system thats CLEARLY against us some say were "manipulating stocks" how

WE LIKE THE STOCK
Omg are we looking at a new award record
WE HOLDING UNTIL WE REACH JUPITER
You're the shield of the realm of men
Do I buy more tomorrow
THIS DUDE HAS SOME TESSERACT 7D LEVEL BALLS
Anytime I thought about selling as I watched my tendies crumble I just thought about how ashamed I would be when DFV posted his update and was still 💎 🤲
He's coming back for all of us 🚀🚀
Robinhood liquidated my gme stock without my permission
I feel disgusted, angry, and hurt that we played the game right and they cheated
If he can be down 11m and hold, we can too
ODIN IS WITH US
NEVER THOUGHT A $14M LOSS IN A DAY WOULD MAKE ME SO HARD
You are an absolute lunatic
You, sir, have earned way more than just money
Im not even jealous of the money

Halt
LOOK AT WHAT THEY’VE DONE TO MY BOY
I SELL WHEN DFV SELLS HE DESERVES THE MOST GAINS I GET THE SCRAPS AFTER
If he's still in, I'm still in
I feel like in 3 years GME is going to be like when people say “harambe” now and you’re like oh yeah that was a thing
If he holds, I hold
Makes me feel better about letting it all ride
I'm here for the history books
Look kids, I was here for this 🙌

Robinhood canceled my purchases, but I still wanna be part of the cause
Holding the 30 i have Buying 15k more at open tomorrow 1/29 BOOM
I WAS HERE WHEN THIS HAPPENED
Hold till it's gold 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Don’t worry king, you’ll make that money back soon
You can see he bought 50,000 stocks for $14
My man made a ballsy move and spent a lot on stocks
Holding after a bad day speaks volumes more than holding after a week of gains
HOLD THE LINE https://twitter
Five years working for GME, 2 running their stores, and I never thought to buy a single share because I hated the corporate leadership
The king is in, so I am in
Whenever I have doubts and my hands feel pulpy, I just think of our dear lord and savior DFV
IT LOOKS LIKE GME IS BACK ON THE MENU BOIS
It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze
DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY
It's not guaranteed to
Repost credit u/OurLordOfWar

I thought he bought the dip
I don't know what any of this is but it sounds important so I WAS HERE TOO
Diamond hands baby

Never take autism meds or Adderall, DFV
Your autism is the shining beacon of hope to us retards and autists and a ray of despair to the suits with silver spoon and Lambos

When GME hits $1000 I’m getting a DFV inspired tattoo

Road to 1 billion 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I will follow you wherever you go my king
You guys I don’t know much about the stock market but this has really inspired me 
Holy, King is holding, so we hold too
HE MAKES THE RULES CONTINUE HOLDING 🦍
Trading 212 suspended buying on US stocks

Just commenting to be a part of history
Commenting to prove I was present in April when this happened
Here after my Reddit recap
Fresh recap
My 🍆hurts looking at this
This just popped into my feed
YO IM HERE BECAUSE GOD HAS SPOKEN,  AND HE TOLD ME TO BELIEVE IN THE WAY
Totally agree
Fckin legend
It’s always about money for me lol

Man, holding must feel so much better with $13M in cash waiting for you
Everyone buying right now
Hey man
If we lose it all just dont kill yoself plzzz
OUR SAVIOR IS IN, I'M STILL IN
OFF WITH THEIR HEADS
GameStop dropped its value by 42% and he had 50,000 shares in it
Thanks for telling
WEBuLL or ETRADE is reliable that I know but yeah unfortunately there is a bit of a setup to establish accounts at a brokerage app/firm to be able to trade the market
HEY
Just commenting so people can know I was a part of history*
I hope you wear a helmet when you go outside
Lol bark dog
I know life is tough when you are broke and stupid and years go by before you realize you were the sucker
It is for those whose lives could be changed
The fact that you were downvotes when I saw your comment speaks volumes about the sheer incompetence of this forum
It's taken a life of its own
Source
Right I’ll die with these stonks I like them that muxh
How would just him selling cause it all to crash
If he were to sell right now with the Data there how much money would he make
Would it be 13 million
Interesting
That's the beginning of the 10Y1D ToS chart for 
GME210416C12
IB data is very good, but I'm too lazy to fire up Trader Workstation and see if they have data further back
RVSD is a simple statistic that measures volume (high colored pink/red) relative to the last n bars if they exist
To be frank, I trust the ToS data over Yahoo but I checked this data (across several different providers) weeks ago
If something like that happens we will probably see more de-grossing events and later regulations that will affect leverage of retail, institutions, or both
Yea links pls, I'm growing suspicious about this
Of course he is suggesting a photoshop
So you think the mods fell for a photoshop
I am am not sure who the mods are and what they verified
No
Oh yeah for sure, tomatoes tomattoes
That’s exactly what I was referring to, but the mods would have known the true data long ago if it was impossible
You use MS paint to make the purchase
The DFV 200 call positions are from December 2019
Hit up Keith Gill himself and ask him
You know
I just dont understand how giving a thought basis on a stock is manipulation
I know this will be a down voted opinion but he/she could afford to loose millions quite frankly still earning millions
I am holding the line, I have diamond hands, I am bringing reality to the unreal bets most of us dream of, just looking to keep us all real and on earth level grounds whilst reaching for the moon, stars or otherwise
You are an absolute legend DFV
I BELIEVE THAT WE WIN
I bought more on the dip
I bought high yesterday at 450
Buy and hold
HE'S

I WILL STAY IN
I'M STILL IN WITH ONE SHARE

Maybe he’ll let us in his time machine after this is all said and done
This will make me sleep better tonight

Editing all old posts to remove content to show support for devs during the API controversy
They thought they shut us down and got out
I dont have any money invested in this, but I can say for so many you are one inspiring human
DFV you are a king among peasants
May your tendies rain down upon us and soak us with your greasy excellence
You lead this charge
I feel like you somehow grasp the gravity of the power you hold
As a stranger, I thank you more than you could ever know

ALL FOR 1
Can anyone explain me what’s happening
IF HE HOLDS WE HOLD
Im just here to be part of history
To take on the upperhand
Why have we been so scared
Well not today
Still young, but no longer impressionable
We have come to pillage
We have come to burn
We have come to incite the riot
We have come to take it over
Idk wtf is going on
This dudes balls are so big they are going to generate a gravitational field
They said Space Force would be useless
Aussie here, bought 1 GME share
Please reach out to AOC if you’re willing to talk to the public about this, a lot of us would love to hear your perspectives on what’s happening in the market outside of GameStop
YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE
If you’re from AUS, NZ or the UK try using the app ‘STAKE’ to trade US stocks, I’ve found it to be the easiest to setup and and fastest to transfer funds, if you use the referral code mitchelli239, you’ll get a free stock, let’s help this thing keep rising baby 🚀 🚀 🚀  pm me if you have any questions about set up
IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN
I did absolutely nothing today but hold
If someone deserves going to Valhalla, is you
No selling
You inspire me
Pretty sure he's seen -40% days before

I wonder what it’s like to have your actions on every news network
If DFV isn't selling, I ain't selling
All hail the king
LOADIN UP ONCE AGAIN IN THE MORNING BOYS

Our prophet speaks
President DFV is gonna be great
Godspeed, DFV
You guys are seriously bringing it
I wanna be this when I grow up
ALL HAIL THE KING
Never to late to say duck the big guys
Yeah for sure, my main curiosity was if it is still gonna keep trending up and further saying duck the big guys at this point or if it's going to fizzle out
You know just as much as the next guy
So
I can’t become a part of this 😂
Look at his post history and scroll down to the beginning and grab some popcorn
I will
Absolute god
Call options
Don’t want the award
The Silverback beast is still here
I was here
IF YOU ✋💎✋ AND CAN TURN MY 5800 INTO 5
I HOLD FOR DFV
It’s never about what people do when they are up, only what they do when they are down
May his song be sung in keeps around the realm
Even if you lose it all you will make it all back from movie rights, book rights, speeches etc

This man brought the us government to its knees
I WAS HERE AS A PART OF HISTORY
His posts are gonna break reddit up votes
Leaving my mark on this beautiful day
I knew our king wouldn’t budge
This guy really figured out a “real life money glitch 2021 unpatched”
I don’t know how stocks work but does this literally have over $30,000,000 in cash
Any way to buy now
Take the free awards
Is that right
Yeah retard are you a dolphin
Thanks for sharing
He was BORN FOR THIS
Is it too late to buy in or is the dip only temporary until after Friday
I LIKE THIS STOCK
Okay boys, fess up and use your three most used emojis,  and tell me what we're supposed to do
WE STAND WITH YOU
Changing the world, literally, incredible
Absolute Boss
I bought one stock of game stop because of this post
A fun project for those that make out well on this should be an app to buy/sell that isn't evil as Robinhood
I love you DFV
This man just had infinite karma
First day learning stocks and I’m so excited
WE HOLD 💎👐
I only have 2 shares of this on Robinhood, should I go to a different app and transfer only 2 shares or just hold and sell once the squeeze happens and then leave RH after
GIVE EM HELL DFV
We will save u bro

Link to the interview
Interview
Same
Yes get in on any dip in price today relatively speaking
NOT ADVICE, I JUST LIKE THE STOCK
Man stuck to his guns despite the negativity
Go back to June of 2019
Actually just read the WSJ article on him, and it makes me feel a lot better about it all
And look, I’m not trying to be pessimistic at all
He has cashed in
And that’s with a $14 million loss for the day
I wonder if you would trigger the short squeeze if you would exercise your option next week 😂
Everyone making a Fidelity account this weekend DO NOT FORGET to turn on real time price updates or else you are on a 15 min delay
Just a simple thank you from someone who needs extra help
ASAP IM THROWING $1k MORE ON $AMC $GME
Can i still get in its sat and got 50gs to burn
I got in 8 days ago, money is tight right now, and I YOLO’ed in with $1,000 which is a lot for me
How about AMC for the other little guys who missed GME
So here’s the question
These next GME YOLO updates will be 🚀🪐There’s gonna be MAJOR FLUCTUATIONS
If you don’t read, BUY & HOLD
Pleaseeeeeeee keep this up, I legit made an account just to comment, love to see this stuff 🙌 I’m not in a position to buy stock myself, due to COVID, but I’m rooting for every single one of you
YOLO
All hail the King of the Autists
Our hedgefund has grown to almost 8mil
Stop Selling
Will someone please calm my nerves
What does this mean in layman’s terms
This guy is going to make $100 MM
Sell your position
Just a lurker
As far as I know, and I'm a lurker myself
Now the holders or diamond hands playing the long game from 6 to 9 months probably are waiting for something even big
DFV could you share some DD with us
Uh, he sold 50,000 shares
If he has 50k shares 1 month ago, and now has 100k shares last week, how did you extrapolate he sold from that data
He has 200k shares u dweeb
Commenting to go down in history
I just saw this in my reddit recap
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery that mediocrity can pay to greatness
Writing a comment on this historic post while i still can…
Smooth long play
When patience literally pays you
At least the awards from this post are some compensation
September 2023, still holding strong
Is DFV baiting us
Just to correct you- he hasn't cashed out his stocks at all
He hasn’t cashed it out
He has cashed out $13
Oh I’m blind
I got in way too late, and put in everything I could
It's not WSB selling
These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price
Every share they sell is borrowed
Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen
This is a repost
What’s your entry point
You’re already back in the green
Cautionary tale for most
Now Robinhood is saying they will allow "limited trading" tomorrow
It also notes the decision to restrict trading was a risk-management choice to meet "financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits
NOTE: In-line links reference additional content of interest chosen by the WSJ news team
This item is part of a Wall Street Journal live coverage event
Maybe he believes we'll moon
I really don't know what I'm looking at lol
Diamond hands, platinum balls
Buy GME and hold
Sign up on binance ore trade or some other stock app
ELON IS THAT YOU
I don't think they even know who he is or that he started this
So
I bought a month ago at around 16
Sold a second before it all started at 21
Now just got back in at 425
Israel is in the game - a lot of noise here as well
Is it still worth buying AMC
AMC is still waiting for short sellers to buy it back
I know this will get buried and I won't get an answer
Is there any value holding the AMC vs cashing out and just buying a single share of GME
I'm pretty sure AMC was a pump and dump
That's my fear and the shills/bots are out in force pushing AMC so that's never a good sign
Just got to diamond hand what you’ve got
Didn’t you have 800 contracts the other day
He did and got like 9 mil
Can someone explain why I saw the price of GME drop from $260 to $193, then back up to $260 at about 4:46 EST
Edit: I mean in the span of a few seconds without any steps in between
After hours trading
Look to my coming on the first light of the fifth day, at dawn look to the east
I REALLY LIKE THIS STOCK
I’m seriously considering dropping 10k through Fidelity on this tonight
I only learned about you guys yesterday
If I had known before I would have been with you guys from the beginning
Should I YOLO Yeet my savings
Don't put it what you can't afford to lose my brother
They’ve shorted more GME stocks and are waiting for us to sell of so they can make a mint
I get that
Is this more of a final desperate play before throwing in the towel, or is there sincere beliefs that there’s more to come
I actually misread it
Shame shame shame
You got nuggies when you could have had tendies
He started with 50k, got it up to 750k and did this
No you don't understand
I’d like to know this answer as well
I just bit the bullet and grabbed one of GME just now but it's not in my positions and is labelled open which I'm guessing is because it's after close
I just got my fidelity accoutn setup but have to wait for funds to transfer
Good luck
You too man
I think one GME, because if gme goes down by 10 bucks your total stocks are down 10 dollars, if AMC goes down 10 its 10 multipled by your number of stocks down
I had considered spread out vs consolidated but figured if AMC was set to climb again I'd stay in to try and get something
Thanks, I know
Don't do it man
It won't 😂 The pessimist in me says it won't hit 500 again
Bought in at 320 for 3 shares BTW, then hopped back on for 2 more for 220
Was so excited to see the update
Upvoted
Glad to see that you cashed some of it - cashing **slowly** is the right move
LETS GET AMC TO THE MOON LIKE GME BEFORE WE'RE SHUT OUT
Alright guys
The comments on DFVs first GME [post](https://www
RemindMe
Oh my gourd
Let’s break the upvote record with this post
Please DFV, use the 13 million to buy shares
Does that cash line mean he sold 13
Can someone please queue me on how to capitalize on what’s going on
Just buy it
Holy cow the legend just blew 17 million for the meme
Hello children I write this to you from the past I love you 
REMEMBER THE FUNDAMENTALS
This is the way
No judgement just wondering, what is his end game
Why settle to be millionaire when he can be a billionaire making history
Bro can I have like a small bit of that to buy some
I heard if we all buy 3-4 ounces of silver we could collapse the entire USA banking system
That’s crazy
Just bought two shares of GME cause I BELIEVE IN THIS SO HARD
Can someone explain to me what's happening
You have candy
But the price didnt go down and my friend doesn't want to sell me the candy back
You are big angry at me and demand I get you the candy back, no matter what the cost
Not only do you have to buy back the candy you sold *at whatever the price the market demands*, but you also get penalized if you're late
Still, some people will get shafted, especially the late buyers, if they don't time their sell right
It's really interesting to see how this whole thing will end
Cool, thank you for the explanation, finally someone who is explaining stuff eli5 :)
Ok, can someone point me to an explanation post
I want to understand whats going on 
EDIT: Not sure why I'm getting down voted
Hi traders
Can someone explain to me how 500 shares is worth 9
When did he cash out 14 million
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M IN
Tis but a scratch
Brokers' disclaimer and terms may have held us back but there is a solution out there and we need your help finding it
An autistic moron such as myself doesn't know what financial advice is
My lord, I am guarding your place at the hills over 360, and I will not fear, cuz I know you will meet me there, and take me beyond
We need a dfv face reveal once this is done
I would stop eating crayons if you asked me to
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU RETARDS
Hey guys I'm new here, I want to know the reasons behind this
STOP AWARDING THIS POST AND BUY GME
WE’RE STILL HERE
IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN
Absolute legend
Where the F is the GME after-hours thread
Blasting off with this legend
ALL HAIL THEM DIAMOND HANDS 💎🙌🏼
I will follow my captain to the moon
IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN👏🏼💎🙌🏼
Am I too late to the party to buy a few tomorrow or is that a really bad idea
I couldn't get in
What app / program is DFV using in these screenshots
You guys know
Just saying
RemindMe
Diamond hands💎🤲, apes together strong
Only issue is, you gotta sell eventually right
Thats for personal profit
I want in, but it's too late
Hey man any chance I can have just $300K
Bought two shares today, sold two shares today
Edit: Well, I sort of listened to people saying "buy" and looking at the trends on the chart and stuff
Keith
Can someone explain his call at 12
I don't follow this super closely and I use an app that has 15 min delay (Wealthsimple in Canada)
I guess I can sell whenever it gets too close to my buy price (90) but I would also like a trip to the moon
You only sell after we land on the moon
You're right
That’s the spirit you beautiful retard
Is it too late to buy GME
I know everyone is saying to HOLD, but for how long
Can someone dumb this picture down for me
Someone do the math for people like me who can’t add, at what GameStop price point does he become a billionaire
You’re a legend
Did Melvin close their positions
So this is pretty much over
Where can I buy it at
Interactive brokers, degiro or any broker you like maybe robinhood i think they lifted the ban
Oh I cant wait to see what happens when the dust is settled
Well hedgefonds will certainly never borrow GameStop stonks again lmao
Idk why you’re getting downvoted
This is exactly what’s going to happen
It’s not 500 shares it’s 500 option contracts
And thats how you create FOMO :D MS Paint and screenshot manipulation
Lol he is down 14m but still holding like a king
Yes he is king indeed
He has a YouTube page where he streams live
Nevermind, can't do it anyway
Pretty sure it's E*Trade
I can see this dude not selling even if the value goes to when he bought it
He seems to be doing it for memes instead of himself
Sell when we reach the stars dawg
I see you don j trump
PRops to rich guy for having enough money to take more risk than poor guy
Is it too late to buy in
Dude in all of this I wish DFV remains safe man
Can someone explain why stocks on Robinhood are always fluctuating but on Fidelity they don't
Hold the line 👑👑👑 We will show these elites who they're messing with 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍
Trying to find out so I can buy a couple shares
You should never have to pay for a drink for the rest of your life
Anyone wanna explain what this means to someone who doesn’t understand stocks
Why on earth would you hold at this point
Sorry I'm a complete noob here, can someone explain to me what's happening with his account now
I have no idea what those number means but i feel like im watching history being made
Yes but lost 14m in value today on paper since he didn’t sell
Sooooo how much has everyone made so far
Can someone explain to me, if someone had $5000 worth of shares in GME last month, what would they be worth today
Gonna laugh when this pops
I’ll buy my one share tomorrow morning
Do you need financial support since you lost so much
A chapter in future college financial text books
BOUGHT MORE AND AM HOLDING
Can someone sum up what's fully going on with facts please
How does one “get in
I tried throwing $10k on 5 GME calls on 1/27 for 250/share but my guy couldn’t execute the transactions
If somebody could confirm my math is correct; does this mean when the share hit $468 I could’ve exercised those contracts for roughly $100k profit 
If you dropped 10K for 250/share that's 10000/250=40
I’m not talking about buying shares I’m talking call options
Blew my mind to find out DFV Hometown is mine as well
Brockton going to put his statue right next to Rocky Marcianos
Hello, i know nothing about stocks how can I support yall:(
Is there a page similar to this one for @ypto
Whether the report is from any software or just excel data 
I lost $265 and I thought it was the end of the world 😂 14 million Wow
He did that yesterday
Paper hands
Will there be another good time to invest or did I just miss it all
Can I have 1% because I’m your homie
What’s YOLO stand for
Young Orangutans Love Oral
Does no one realize how easy it is to photoshop this screenshot
He has 14Mil cashed out
Don't say that
Ok
I get more and more concerned when I keep consistently seeing that negative
What is yolo
You only live once
Buy 1 share for DFV and 2 for the Gipper
Who is DFV
He’s been in since 2019
If you posted this at 1pm instead of after-hours, it would've gone up instead of stagnated at -40%, and would've probably kept going up via momentum
Not trying to go against you though
EDIT: if someone can explain why I'm wrong instead of downvoting, I'm ready to learn
He is not trying to manipulate the stocks
This page is about people making their own mind up about things not creating an army to force gains
The downvotes are because you’re basically asking him to force the stock up for you
I was bricking it for the last hour of trade about whether he’d sold because you’re right, when people think he sells it will plummet
DFV FOR POTUS
DFV FOR KING OF WORLD
DFV IS MY GOD
DFV= Psyop
Is he gonna hold these to zero
I am so out of the loop
THE SHOWS GOES ON
Is tomorrow the big hold or the big sell
Have you been reading the sub at all
I'm hoping you cash out 5 mill
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
How’d it feel to “lose” 14 million dollars
Dude has affected by he entire world economy in a way
Is it too late to Join in on this
Yes, but tomorrow his shares might be worth $25m
Look at picture
Darn
This comment was removed because automod thinks it mentions a stock with a market cap below $1B
Oh, that's over my head then, sorry
It's NOT about amc
You are a great mom
While you're realizing things, take your time to realize how easy it is to see if it's fake or not
Photoshopping for a whole year, impressive
Instead of being sarcastic, you could've spared three seconds of your precious time and clicked on his profile as I said
Just trolling, I like the stock too
Lol he could have had over 30 mil cashed out
If the stock is at 0$ tomorrow and he loses everything he still has in it, this homie still made himself 8 figures from a 50k investment
I mean I'm not bashing him I'm just saying I don't understand the holding its gonna go back to normal at some point
People told him to cashout 150
Good for him
Yes, but he could've swayed major sentiment if he posted earlier ("hold up, the god of GME is holding
If he did that he would be influencing stocks
It definitely would’ve benefited him you’re right though
No worries man
If you’re aware of anonymous from /b/ it’s much the same sentiment as is seen there “not your personal army”
Can someone please explain what the Cash Total line means
When he will sell it will trigger a crash :o
Can somebody explain what is going on with this
Can someone explain this like I am a retard (because am)
It’s MA’AM
Can someone explain what am I supposed to see
Can someone please explain all this to me 
OMFG
MANS MAKING MILLIONS OFF RETARDED KIDS ON REDDIT
YOLO in IPOD,IPOE,IPOF
KEITH KEITH KEITH KEITH
You are an idiot man
DFV saw this coming 13 months ago
He’s articulate, calculating and incredibly smart
This dude couldn't dryhump a screenshot of his portfolio without Janet Yellen giving him a prostate tickle
Your situation and his are NOTHING ALIKE
God bless him, I don't think he violated any lawful or ethical standards, and I feel confident he'll breeze out the other end of this with the means to give himself and his family a quality life, but you won't
Rough math: I turned ~$950 into $2500
If you think you're sending a message, nobody is reading
I hope it all works out for you bag holders
The hedge fonds
That's not at all how this works
When the price spikes, would it be smart for me to sell my 6 shares and then when it dips, buy 20+ back
NEVER SELL
If timing the market was that easy, everyone would do it
Just hold and sell at what you're comfortable with
Genuine questions
Wait so people are saying he is holding yet he sold off $13
Careful could be a big scam
There’s smooth brained and then there’s do you even have a brain
Can anyone give me a eli5 why he wants to predict gme stocks would be so low on 16th April
He predicted theyll be so HIGH
Just sell lol
Please for the love of God take your cash OUT
Robin hood have shown no fear in illegal market manipulation
The last thing you want is your account locked for 'suspicious activity' and disappeared
Please take your cash money out
You all realize this guy probably has another account with the same amount that he sold out of at peak, right
He started with 50k
Wait, does this mean he cashed some out to have almost $14m in cash
He sold 300 calls for 9 million yesterday
The King of WSB isnt stupid hes up 13 million
Wait how does he have 9 million
He has 50,000 shares
Those are calls not shares
What should we expect the aftermath to be
Someone please tell me what is going on with the whole GME thing
I'm not trolling I want a deeper explanation I'm super new to this all
Can I have some lol
Lmao right
Guys
This guy had 700k+ to invest in the first place
It was 50k
How has 50k gone up to 13mill when the stocks went up by like 37x
Also
Go learn what options trading is to learn why it went up by so much more than 37x
Also this is pretty much a casino
Love it AmC
Ay so uh anyone want to walk me through something
What are all the references to retards in these subs
I’m totally new to this
If you guys only listen to me on one thing it is now
I can't by GME should I try getting NWARF
Just because a stock is shorted doesn’t mean a squeeze will happen
Is he playing you all like fools
Guys a whale
He started with 50k
And tomorrow you buy to make your loss back
I’m new to stocks and honestly o got scared when heard realized was not possible to buy anymore
Yesterday he was at 47 million, today 33 million
Could have even sold this morning
Why would he lie
Hold brotha we will be back and you’ll have a whole new car to insure
Panic sold gme like a retard, holding bb and nok tho
You have become the very thing you swore to destroy
To Tendie Town
Forget everything else
Plot twist, he didn't mean to hold, the apps wouldn't let him close
I hate you
Is he losing money
Hey bro
Thank you, now I get it
Thanks for the encouragement, but sadly, I cannot buy stocks because of my student visa status in the USA
Hey, I wanted to bother you with one more thing I cannot reason
Not robinhood
Thanks
If we all plan to sell the same day, some people will undercut and a lot of people will be under the bus
Buy and hold till we hit balls deep
You mean just keep buying GME stocks
Buy and HOLD until it hits the moon
Quite the interesting concept
If you have 50k you’re not ‘still poor’, you weren’t poor when you started
Don’t get me wrong
Also
This is the king who started the process
Don’t be scared
No he's not
Now you're just being greedy
Your all fools
I imagine this is a photoshop and he already sold
You’re a moron
I mean, he 2 years ago bought 40k of shares and had held them up to today
The only 'change' that can come from this is restrictions on 'retail' traders
Doesn't matter in the end
What is the next big stock that I should buy
We don’t know
Can I get $50,000 to yolo
Has anybody considered that he’s just a false prophet that’s leading us to financial ruin
No, something something too the moon
GUYS, DINT FIRGET ABOUT AMC, FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD GME PRICE
This idiot needs to sell
People said that to him when he was at -30k almost a year ago
You’re actually pathetic if you believe that
No I just understand when someone knows more about something than me
Why is that
Yes but he was proved to be correct by an astounding amount
Maybe it comes crashing down and he loses it but he clearly knows better what he is doing than you or I considering how much he’s made
Stonks only go up
Since we are all buying GME, can someone give me enough money for one share
An intern at work today basically asked me the same thing and I told him
I’m gonna try to convince my dad to give me money so I can spend it on GME, wish me luck guys
HOLD on to options and shares
Imagine losing $14,000,000 because some people on the internet told you to hold lmao
Hi, retard who doesn't understand stocks or anything
Why not sell now
Can we admire him for how lucky he got and not rally behind him like we're an army
How can you still hold
He's up a safe 13m
Dude, just sell and take the biggest W in the history of WSB
So he lost money
Look at “cash total” that’s what he pulled out, he’s not taking nearly as big of a risk as some people here are
Back to loss porn I love it
Don't hold for online memes you fool
Bro he turned 50k into 14 million
Should have sold yesterday
This guy is the OG on GME
No
We like the stock
Where my fellow NOK ibvestors at
Lol idiot,
Can anyone help me out with a couple bucks through PayPal, volks71folk@yahoo
Amazing the irrational nonsense on here
I still don’t have a full idea of what’s going on here and you make a good point but I guess making Reddit history is more profitable then cashing out on the top
What if they are a “She” 
Good to know, was unaware
You are the worse kind of retard
This is the proof we need boys
If you need me, I'll be in my new Porsche😎
He's already sold a ton
So he decided to lose 14 million dollars today for upvotes 
Get out now dude, you're gonna lose it all
You're not even a retard are you
Just calling it how I see it
How do you know
Nobody wants to take him down
We want to take shorts down, the people who are betting against the price of GME
He’s been holding since late 2019
Yesterday he was at 47 million, today 33 million
You realize you're in a casino asking advice on what to call at the roulette table
Some have already cashed out, others (who bought shares when it was cheap) will make a profit either way
Theres more to come
Your moms going down this week
Yes I think we should think in relative terms, this guy went from 50k to 13mil
I will be messaging you in 7 days on [**2021-02-05 00:40:11 UTC**](http://www

So quick question here, does Robinhood have stock, and we shortsell it since it is probably going to tank soon

Nevertheless, he persisted
Hold the door 
Believe in yourself
The squeeze has not be squoze
You are my HERO
This is just what I needed
He’s in, I’m in
IF HE'S STILL IN, WE ARE STILL IN
Everyone's saying "If he's still in, I'm still in" but he only posts after close
What platform is that
Your intestinal fortitude is impressive, sir
YOU'RE STILL HERE
IF HE’S STILL IN, IM STILL IN ‼️‼️‼️
Well
Anyone know what site he's using
I'm inspired
With your shield or on it

DFVs hands have formed into a strong alien element only found on the moon
Kneel you fools
After market trading on GME is insane right now

After hours now - may the price please rise like it did last night
Based AF, he knows

I am still in too for real tho
If he can hold 19M, I can hold 326K
I’m buying more
DFV you are a light in the darkness
Dumb question
You all must have an exist strategy
What is “transfer money”

Halting buys on GME today made me actually decide to buy more
Me too, Streisand effect
IF HE’S STILL IN
Didn't use any margin
I LIKE THE STOCK
IF HE'S STILL IN, THEN I'M STILL IN
But seriously this is still pretty amazing
If he can HOLD at the dip then so can you
If this gentleman continues to hold financial investments in the video game retailer Gamestop then I too will continue to hold such investments
Due to the brokerages shutting down the ability to buy, DFV’s portfolio dropped a substantial amount where it otherwise would not
IF HE'S STILL IN I'M IN

You are a true hero, honestly
Hold for DFVA
Do a limit buy to set the value above which you will not buy
Keep the faith you didnt "lose" money today unless you bought above 265 it will rise again
Incredible
Y O L O indeed
What app does he use that formats his earnings like that
While I certainly believe that GME will go beyond $500, after this is all over there will be a huge rug pull in the market with all the new money in the game
IF HE'S STILL IN I'M STILL IN
PASTA HANDS
Gonna start calling you Muad'Dib
IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN
DFV is gonna go down in the History books, people are gonna make songs about him, hell, he'll even get taught about in school

You're not a man
IF HE HELD WE WILL REMAIN HOLDING TOO
I love this man right now
I’ve been waiting for your post
I LIKE THE STOCK, WE ALL LIKE THE STOCK
ONE OF US
I’m sorry that I still don’t completely understand but I’ve been studying as I recently got to a point in my life to where I’m going to be able to use money to make money, granted, not a lot but I finally have a little freedom
Are you saying that those individuals or companies that have shorted stocks have to buy them back tomorrow
Yes essentially
Thanks
I honestly don't know where they are
Thanks
From my understanding, all profits you make are taxable which is understandable but here’s what I don’t get
Buy stock A for 1 dollar, sell it at 5 for a 4 dollar profit
Do you pay taxes on it then
Do you pay taxes as you go or just at the end of the year
Logic would say yes, but like I said, I’m new
I have seen that taxes are calculated differently based on different factors like how long you held onto the stock
Yeah I think we are all in for a learning curve when it comes to taxes
Nice, I haven’t had much luck with google
WE LIKE THIS STOCK
I needed this
HOLD FAST BOYS THE TENDIES WILL SOON COME
At least it’s bouncing back

DFV is the fearless leader we all rally around
GME AND AMC BABY
WE ARE ALL BUT RAINDROPDS, FLOODING THEIR TOWN
Man I wish I had the money to spare when GME was LOW
I had a moment of weakness and RH exploited it, they rejected a trailing stop order i was trying to place and just straight up sold my stocks instantly
POWER TO THE PLAYERS 
IF HE HOLDS WE HOLDS

DFV with the DFBs
You dont owe us anything, don't hold cause of us
You have an army of retards ready to strike
The manipulation today triggered a stop loss that I did not think would be hit under normal circumstances
THE FIRST TIME I SMILE AFTER LOSING 6k
Efff you and I will see you tomorrow
God almighty; I’m holding the line in the trenches with my savior DFV
I hope he doesn’t disappear after all of this
Not related but I just realized you can do that magic eye thing with the scrolling banner and it 'pops' out at you like those posters in the mall back in the 90s
Also wtf is happening with GME

HOLD THE LINE COMRADES
Commenting just to be a part of this
Can someone explain (ELI5) the second line that reads "Apr 16 '21 $12 Call"
Those are call contracts that expire on Apr 16, at a strike price of $12 meaning as long as the shares are above $12 each they’re in the money and as long as they’re above the strike price plus whatever premium he paid which can vary a lot they’re profitable
This is the QAnon of amateur investing
Australian reporting for duty

So Robinhood sold off my shares at a loss and I didn't buy on margin
The biggest balls on the internet
WE ALL HOLD
I can't even buy any since Trading212 has stopped us buying :(
I started buying today as what Robinhood has done is disgusting
Disgusting and unconscionable
When GME play is over then everyone needs to leave Robinhood and never go back
I am disgusted by this whole thing and I am showing my disgust of the powers that be by coming all the sidelines and getting involved by buying GME on dips and holding
Im still in
Henlo, I only started this game today
Okay okay we still in this HOLD
Your screwed
This is what keeps us here
Hey Citadel, buy my shares

I have a bad feeling about this all
It is sad that i cant join this crusade
God bless you sir
So
I have NO clue what this means, but if i buy stocks for say 20 bucks, how much can i earn back
Is there any reason to buy now if you can't get a whole stock

Question, if these hedge funds go bankrupt, doesn't that absolve them from buying the stocks back which would then tank the stock

He’s holding that amount of shares in gamestop
What a bunch of sore losers
God emperor
Where is everyone going since robinhood is deep street
If he's in I'm still in
On the brightside you've got literally millions in tax write offs just sitting here I hope when you've finally squeezed them dry you buy back in high (nowhere near this limit) and just hold for eventual tax purposes
I salute you man 👏
You are a freaking legend
In how many hours is the market going to be open again

Is dfv posting anywhere on this

Mad lad 💎🙌

Depends on if you can find somewhere will sell them
I bought shares for GME but it won't be going into it until tomorrow, yeah, isn't that how that works
When it is put into the stock tomorrow do I get shares totaling what I would've got at the end of today's trading period or once the trading sessions start up again tomorrow

This would allow you to support these companies and keep them afloat and would help those who work for them have a Job
Once you've done playing those Games you then then sell them or donate them, So people who can't afford to buy new releases can enjoy paying them and experience what others were taking about

What a legend
Go ahead and look up the roaring kitty(DFV's youtube channel) to get what im saying
Yes
What happened: A number of wealthy people attempted to make themselves richer by manipulating loopholes in the market
What does this mean: This means that the rich people who were engaged in unethical practices (see above) were caught with their pants down

I can see the spike happening when we get the short squeeze going, then they just tell us that the system went down, or there is network traffic, while we tried to cash in our gains
I am putting my faith in the rest of you guys
I’m here to be the part of history too
The legend held, so did I

Good luck

Yes

Keep calm and keep holding
What app you using to purchase
First timer
I'm on IG Trading, not the best or cheapest platform but I've been with them for a few years now
My W-8BEN form had lapsed so I quickly filed it so I could get involved in this caper
Sometimes I make the position amount the stop
I
So 100K position would be a stop at 97K loss to stay within 3% risk
But if you have a 100K account and you only put 1K on a position with no stop, that's still only 1% risk to your account
All this is just a hobby though, as they say on here
I'm a retard, don't listen to me 😄
You made it
Ya, I turned $500 into $50,000
I can’t afford to wait
That act itself would drive the price down and from what I understand it’s in a Roth IRA which is complicated
And leave everyone else floating in a sea of darkness without a life preserver
Just asking
Each option contract is for 100 shares
Thanks
How do you figure
Can you tell me how that is
Yes
Can someone explain what I’m missing here
Send picture please
He’s dumb for not selling
I respectfully disagree with your statement that he is dumb for not selling
Ironically, selling is the SHORT play for him now
Let’s see his live view on his account
Don’t stay in just because he’s in
Yeah I try to explain this to people I know
Well boys and girls looks like i'm backing up the truck monday
This is beyond undervalued
Take it to man, buy them all up
I'M NOT SELLING #BIOWAR $BCRX
Bcrx is a top company
Biowar
That sounds amazing
Even without the short squeeze, BCRX has the possibility of being a 50bagger from current levels, it just takes time
What’s BCRX
Bio stock that is heavy heavy shorted in which they would never see it coming
Holy crap
To the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Let’s teach these shorts another lesson
Squeeze here would be nearly instant and epic
I've been slowly slapping at this all week
It's coming
Yolo #biowar #bcrx
Get It China
The BioCRXst is coming for the shorts
Saving lives and still shorting
BIOWARRRRRRRR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Derisked
I will be buying on Monday
How high will it fly
If we push past 12
Sky is the limit
What's the institution ownership
Factor D oral inhibitor in phase 1 study has already trumped Alexion's Factor D
Not only will this fly
Monday IS #BIOWAR
I'm in
I've got 20k shares and about $85k left in cash
IMHO it’s a great long term hold - whether or not there is a war on the shorts
But I’m getting pretty pissed at watching SP drop everyday from the shorting
We like the stock
Retail holders are all long 
I have been invested in BCRX for 10 months and it is highly undervalued with 500+ million revenue potential of Orladeyo (already approved in US and Japan, EU approval by March)
Way too easy, already has approval in US and Japan, Europe next month
Absolutely deserves a short squeeze
BCRX is a cheap stock
Folks, read the valuable DD by  [u/DerpyMcOptions](https://www
CEO john Stonehouse stated in most recent JPM conference (available on the company website) that all operations are funded into 2023 and the company does not plan to revise guidance
Hey guess what
You can buy as much BCRX as you want on Robin the hood
BCRX #Biowar using Robin-the-hood
BIOWAR on MONDAY
Shorts will burn
BIOWAR $BCRX SHORTS HAVE MANIPULATED THIS SO LOW
Yep, you are right
Did DD
Mms trying to get you to sell BCRX
So under the Radar
BCRX TO THE MOON - 50k in earlier today
Serious question if the short interest has been 30 million shares since before the FDA approval, what the heck is going on
You’ll see the big blocks at close almost every day
Heavily manipulated it’s make no sense for the price to be this low I mean it’s insane already has approved drug Orladeyo the only oral medication currently available for HAE   Oral factor d inhibitor with great potential not only for PNH but many other immune mediated diseases I can go on and on the point is it’s unfair what the shorts are doing to this great company
I really like this stock
Been in BIOWAR with the short institutions holding down BCRX stock since April 2020
Investors decide the value NOT Citadel🔥🩳🔥🩳🔥🩳🔥🩳🔥🩳🔥🩳
WE LIKE THE STOCK 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
WE LIKE THE STOCK
He's gonna have beautiful retarted grandchildren
I’m sitting on 30k shares and only going to keep buying more
Nwbo the same
May I ask why BioWar
Shorts have been controlling BCRX for far too long
I see that's why, thanks for explaining it
The story is there
I’m new to Reddit and “shorts” and other lingo
WELCOME
Sounds like FSR and NK
Where are you seeing this data
Terminal, fintel isn’t that accurate
Either way the shorts are gonna burn
Just read the transcript from their last call
Biowar is actually the next level of morality of WSB
Easily 25+
I’m new to trading and trying to learn, but what is the difference between waiting until Monday versus buying today
Market closed
The goal is to buy low
BHC, shorts crushed this healthcare stock as well
Hang on there 2day redditor
I've been in BCRX since April and followed it closely
Check out the company
Doing DD now
Edit: thanks for the reward
I don't really use YouTube videos that much for research
Here's a YouTube video: [https://www
It’s not a trap, they’re 100% correct
Yup
Thank you
Whats that matter
Indeed they did
I know it - been watching every development for 13 months and agree with everything you said
Where are you finding this data
A lot of the guys have been invested a while and follow on StockTwits
This is only short float 17
Buddy if that number is true its probably of all shares
Short interest is a little above 20%
Thanks for the explanation
I think it would be nice if there are some criteria we need to list and follow for a good stock candidate aside from % short interest
Well, there’s a lot of info on this stock
S
Oh, just a few more details
Never seen a more Undervalued Bio the more approvals we get the lower these scumbags take it
Worth so much more than that
I agree
Why the moon when we can go to the Mars
Okay but honestly no one should be using Robin Hood anymore
I'm going to be doing my own research today but reading everything thus far, my confidence in the company is higher than the potential downsides
Cant wait to make these shorts homeless for hurting people with rare and debilitating diseases
I only have a couple bennies to put in
To the moooooooooonday
This isn't even hard to make, I will actually try to replicate that later today as a fun project
Why is it that all the accounts commenting on this BCRX thread have almost no karma or were literally only created minutes ago
I mean, not all accounts
Hi
SwiftyTwits is kinda raging at the machine here, but most of us have gotten obsessively nitty gritty reading every SEC filing, all the analysis, following conferences, checking out the competition
Hey guys here’s some due diligence on #BCRX
The pain commences Monday
BUY HOLD GET RICH
BCRX Biowar 70% of available float is short
I thought short interest was more like 20% - 30% of total float, are you removing the tute shares from the float to get that number
Yes, tutes are holding approx 75% of the available shares
It trades above 100% of total shares because of all the shorting
I understand how short interest can get over 100%
The only way short interest gets insanely high like that is if tutes are underwater on short positions and instead of covering when the price spikes they double down on their short positions
I have BCRX stock because I like the stock
They are underwater dude it was about 50m naked shares short before approval
Yes those shares do exist
It is sick that people would like to profit off a potential drug failure and when they lose the bet they are incentivized to manipulate the market so they can cover
It would squeeze so fast it would blow your mind
Basically there’s no shares to buy
LETS GET ITTTTTT 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
YOLO
BCRX BIOWAR ON MOOOOOOOONDAY 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Nobody selling
Short float
Over 70% of float has been short for months
Deeeep
I’m just a retard n I wanna see how smart is their “smart money”
Not that it "seems" to be
Good article
We like the stock, this company is on a warpath to fight rare and horrible diseases, some with no current effective treatments, and they are winning
Great company with great pipeline to help humanity
Buy and hold for 2 years
I show current Citadel ownership at 5%
GET THE WORD OUT
Please educate me on how to find if something is being shorted
Right on bro
I meant Pivotal trials not people trials
We down from chicago
Burn the shorts Monday
Target acquired
How good is the pipeline
Big pipeline
I see orladeyo and they only real advantage I see is oral, which should not be discounted
Factor D is the game changer
Factor D has FDA fast track and orphan drug status
If you just want the numbers, look here
Nice good enough for me
Cant say I didn’t try
Biocryst is a god company
Didn't they just get FDA approved
Got it
In early December
This is the perfect storm
You must really like this stock huh

Did some digging on this one
Anyone know how big the Factor D drug they are working on could be
If the data continues to be as promising as it was then billions
Billions,  the HAE drug is worth a billion a year
Who cares
Munchescoochie has it right
All this info in company presentations on the BioCryst website
Take a look at $AUPH
Not enough shorted
I'm in AUPH but it is true, it isn't really shorted, just unloved for all it will do for the world
You never know what is going on
Let me explain why BCRX is the next and the best target after GME
Dude
The BCRX pipeline had been brought up, and will continue to be addressed in this thread and others
Monday is going to be epic
It’s the perfect storm
Yup, send them hedgies away with a space x rocket
It’s about time people notice that absurd shorting of BCRX
HES STILL IN IM STILL IN
At this point, just with the 13 mil you've cashed out, you can chuck all of it in VTI, get 220k/year of dividends as income to live comfortably on, and let it go up, which means divvies will increase too
Holding GME shares is like holding the One Ring, and these updates are my Sam

Incredible
Anyone actually going to a GameStop store to buy anything this weekend
Holding **obviously** and *for* ***ever***
RH verified new options expiring 1/29 would remain in close-only positions (even accounts with on-expiration options powers couldn't short the stock today)
So yeah, ***e-v-e-r-y*** short position just expired ITM

Isn’t it a real possibility that they can get out of this
I’m holding, but I have a feeling we aren’t gonna see a squeeze
I welcome the viewpoints and discussion of others

In addition to paying this man his dues for being an absolute legend who will probably end up getting played in a movie by some Hollywood actor who still won’t make as much for the movie as he did in this
I think we all owe a little debt of gratitude to GameStop
Apes together strong, but not all apes help stonk by investing, some apes help by running company
Besides GME continue to hold AMC
People should read the first posts DFV stated posting about GameStop
I’m so sad I didn’t jump on this
Excuse me but I have a question
So clearly GME is for the people
BCRX is the real deal folks
Just a girl sitting on 102 shares of  AMC at $11, waiting to see some YOLO numbers on that

Tristan, we are a legit group of investors who travel in a pack
Bro take a look at what everyone’s saying
Sorry, but when I looked just about every account in this thread is just a few days or hours old, and all chose to make their first Reddit comments about this stock
Edit: just like you, apparently
Yeah I mean that’s fair, my old Reddit account got banned for “profanity” lol
You realize 2/3 of the accounts on wsb are from the past few days right
Im invested in this but do your own DD :)
I know a lot of these dudes from the ST board and its prob true many of the accts are new but we’re not new to this stock
They are probably the MM for this stock, holding short position as hedge
Plz get facts right
On fintel it’s 96
If I'm not mistaken, its higher
Thks
Fintel lists Citadel as a 5% owner
You can look up short interest on a ticker on web brotha
UK here, I like this stock
Short volume ratio is not the same as short interest
Im also a AUPH  long since 2016, just not exactly what people are looking for right now
I think management tries
Google result, 14%short interest on $AUPH as on 01/15, No data after , am I right
Wont sell
Excellent
Couldn’t agree more
Should’ve bought GME
Yes
I’ll buy something
NOK is a diversion

Your balls must influence tides
Back in October I brought a random selection of shares I thought would do well in an extended lockdown

As a Boomer with an IRA I just wanna say: HOLD
Lol Robinhood wouldn't let me buy one GME stonk because I had GME stonk
SERIOUS QUESTION - Fidelity will only allow a Limit order 50% above market price when placed
Protect yourself at all times, my dude
I have 33 shares of AMC
One night I dreamed a dream
IF HE’S IN, I’M STILL IN
What’s going on with $AMC
If I was a part of this sub months ago I would’ve easily recognized your fortitude and gorilla grip on this sexy stock and I’d have gotten in earlier
Did anyone see the fat twat from the NASDAQ asking for more regulation 
Bought 5 shares today average price of $340 if he’s still in im still in
I hold GME, it rises
I like GME and AMC 💕
Should i buy into this now
Can we do the GME thing with AMC real quick
Can’t afford GME now but what bout AMC
I’m late to the party, but better late than never
M O O N D A Y 🚀 🚀 🚀
I got one share at 380 whatever but I'm holding it
If you’re from AUS, NZ or the UK and STILL HAVENT BOARDED THIS ROCKET 🚀 🚀 try using the app ‘STAKE’ to trade US stocks, I found it to be the easiest to setup and and fastest to transfer funds, if you use the referral code mitchelli239, you’ll get a free stock, let’s help this thing keep rising baby 🚀 🚀 🚀  pm me if you have any questions about set up
Is it too late too buy more GME
Robinhood needed emergency funding, lied, and then tanked their reputation
Robinhood still needed more cash quickly to ensure that it didn’t have to place further limits on customer trading, said two people briefed on the situation who insisted on remaining anonymous because the negotiations were confidential
Robinhood, which is privately held, contacted several of its investors, including the venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Ribbit Capital, who came together on Thursday night to offer the emergency funding, five people involved in the negotiations said
Whats up with AMC
What a legend
Pay your taxes
My whole saving was 2000
Any guesses as to which whales are on the GME long side
I have $2-400 right now that I want to go in with, how can I get started TONIGHT
I want to start ASAP, I think AMC what I’ll have to do, I’m watching it fluctuate feeling helpless to get involved
YES, I want money, yes I understand it’s a risk, but more than anything I crave and love this solidarity
Newbie from Australia supporting the cause
You have candy
But the price didnt go down and my friend doesn't want to sell me the candy back
You are very angry at me and demand I get you the candy back, no matter what the cost
I am pissed the way the news (CNBC), are bringing in “experts” who want to talk about the new laws this situation should bring about
Seriously man, you represent the best of us
Listen up newbie retards, I’ve been a lurker for 9 years and this is my first post out of sheer freakin frustration
I feel obligated to say that I am slightly retarded and didn’t take any financial advice before buying 25 shares this afternoon
Should I buy GME
Was one share person until yesterday
GameStop just got ps5 and Xbox series x back in stock
WHY DONT WE ALL GO TO NYC AND TRADE FROM OUR PHONES WHILE SITTING IN THEIR LOBBY
Is AMC something to get in on
I’m really surprised how composed a ton of people are on here, not even acknowledging the insane amount of press coverage, and that this will be at least a famous case study, and at best a piece of history
Hey everyone, I’m brand new to this game
So I’ll buy a few GME on Monday at the open that I’m willing to completely loose in a worst case scenario
But hey, why aren’t we stepping the game up to the next level and actually help GME to report a blowout quarter
If everyone spends only 500$ for maybe a new PlayStation instead of ordering it on Amazon, we may even be rescuing an American Icon with real jobs for young kids along the way to Mars
Just imagine GME reporting a blowout quarter in March
Where’d everybody go
Random dude makes millions and we’re all happy for him
I bought 2000$ worth of GME yesterday
Best regards from Europe, buying all the shares I can to cover up for you retards🚀🚀
Bought at $325 sending this stock to $3500 REMOVE UPPER STOCK LIMIT THERES A 7000 STRONG WALL AT $425

Viva la resistance 💎💎💎💎✊🏽
Hello from Australia retards
Is 100% the magic number to stay above, or can they still be squeezed at 90%
I don't know
Yeah, I was asking because I'm in AMC and they are at nearly 80% of float in shorts
How many shares did you purchase
Good stuff
I’m sold
I LIKE THE DFV
Can you adjust that limit in the future 
Yes but I would have to watch it very closely and keep adjusting it to make sure it doesn’t get hit before I really want it to
Yes sirrrr
YES
I'm in the same boat
Build
This is the way
BTW - I joined after learning that the goal is burn the hedge fund guys
I’m holding amc too
Fellow retard here
Dear stonks fans, I have $400 and want to take my kids to Disney
GME holdings now $4,675,000
The moment you can gain enough money not to have to work any day of your life, you should sell
Do y'all think that after this weekend it'll still be worth buying
Is this your last post m8
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
Godspeed you legend
Yesss

Restored which was lost

I'M STILL IN
STILL IN BOYS
When this is all said and done
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
Not my proudest fap but no shame either :)
This is the way
After a few tequila shots, I bought 1 share of GME and some BB instead of paying my car payment
Anyone else forgot about Covid19 because of DFV
IF HES STILL IN, I’M STILL IN
Here’s some free karma
I own 5 shares
Praise to our pioneer and savior, DFV
IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN
Guys I bought today
You can BUY GME anytime
Boss hog
I haven’t been this active on Reddit since r/freefolk were talking about GoT spoilers
I literally exercised my options to buy more Gamestop because of you
I wish I'd paid more attention today
Now that the SEC has made a statement in favor of retail, I'm looking to buy
Has Fidelity halted any trades AT ALL since this started
Retard here
This is why you hold
Rich in karma and money lmao
Incredible
You gotta know when to hold 'em, know when to hold 'em, know when to hold away, know when to hold
So newb question can I buy after hours
They're scared
They're shaking
They're ready to fold
We're ready to hold
So this is the roaring twentys
I have two shares
I put in what I could afford for the cause, don't want to risk more past that if 
Why aren't BB,AMC, and NOK, going up like GME
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'm STILL IN
I'm not even fit to lick this guy's sweaty ball sack
Together
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN 💎👐🏻
So Monday it is #stonks 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Can’t Stop
Stupid question comming from a complete retard: Is it still worth to buy a share of GME
I LOVE YOU DFV
Absolutely, buy at a dip and HOLD ONTO IT
I heard that Melvin had announced that they were out of GME
Liars lie
Only 8% out from what I read on the Reuters article
Look bro be careful if you do and watch it
Savage lmfao
I didn’t see any halts, no
I may start an account this weekend, then
Yeah, I'm in
DFVs initial investment was $53,000
Use a limit order instead of a market order to control the price you are willing to buy for
Thereabouts yes
Short answer: The rocket has departed, but you can still get on before it reaches its peak altitude
Focus on the data for short %age of overall float
I have legit no clue what you just said, but I'm in
Also, buy $AMC for the retarded retards who missed the first short bus to the moon
I will just leave this comment to remember that I was here
Exercised my 1/29 contract to shares
That's it, HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN 🚀🚀🚀🌝🌛
HE IS STILL IN 📈🚀📈🚀
So
After this is over, and i finally have some capitol
I'm really over worrying about money
You know what makes it even better
They will see their own falling, and it will be for ever be remembered
You absolute madlad
THE KING IS HERE
AND HE IS STILL IN
BOW TO THE ABSOLUTE REGARD
Give me a reason to bet teh house this weekend
Good evening
If he’s still in, I’m still in
I always thought that regular people couldn't do this kind of stuff, I was wrong
WE LIKE THE STOCK 💹🚀
HE HELD THE GAMESTOCK
If I were u/DFV I would have sold and bailed on you retards a long time ago
Then again maybe I wouldn't have because if I were u/DFV I would have balls the size of Jupiter
Get ready for FUD (Fear Uncertainty Doubt) campaigns on the weekend
The number of posts with supposed "level headed" advice about how a short squeeze is much more difficult to achieve than we all think and how the strong and powerful hedge funds have much more cards up their sleeve and to "rethink your strategy" but still "Go GME
Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your GME shares
I LIKE THE STOCK
This is not financial advice
Hey I know you prob won’t read this, but I wanted to say I’m sorry the media dragged your name into this and basically DDOS’d you

First post in this community
Came here to say this entire WSB community has been nothing short of historic
He can bang my nonexistent girlfriend anyday
Is it still worth it to buy and hold even after I missed the initial hype
I bought 4 at 420, so bail me out guys lol
I’m watching the Big Short tonight to keep me motivated
Guys stay strong, remember we are retarded, they can't stop this train
If DFV holds, I hold
I got 1 share of GME @350 - HOLDING 🚀🚀🚀
Gme will be the next gme, it didn't even start yet
HIGH if everyone holds
So sad for that！！😭😭😥😥
Wednesday or Monday
MOON MONDAY
IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN
SAY IT WITH ME: IF HE'S STILL IN
This guy's brain is 100% wrinkles
Holding >
Selling gme is a sin
Just got into the fight today, bought 8 shares of GME for around 315 and ready to hold with you guys
Been lurking - seems I can finally post now
Even bought at 320 at close as ordered
Like many of us, I can only afford one share
I hold 50 GME, which I could get call options that cheap now
Are you leaving that $13 million in cash there just so you can keep including it in the screenshots
D^E^E^P F^U^C^K^I^N^G V^A^L^U^E
Should I keep amc 
The last 9 minutes before EOD were a thrill ride
I've only got £100 in
I could spend that £100 going and waving a placard and feeling good for a day
I'm willing to lose it all to send a message, so are others
HOLD til we reach the MARS💎🙌
Just commenting for the posterity of history
Hey brother, thank you for doing this
If I hold, will you pay my student loan debt 😭😂
So are we still doing this
That'd be amazing I'm stuck working 40 hours a week and didn't have enough to buy when the numbers started flying rip stay proud
How can they just not let us buy GME
I’m literally crying right now
Markets down, they have to go after the others to make up losses
Apes better together
Come on man let me get 10k
Yolo
I can always make more money
Who would have thought that just a few retards liking a stock would make history
I like the stock
I do not like Melvin Capital or Citadel
I like tendies
I do not like bears
I bought 2 shares at the open
Jesus, that is nice
Hopefully I tend my wounds by Monday that Robinhood created
EVERYONE IN THIS CHAT SHOULD GO TO A GAMESTOP THIS WEEKEND AND POST A PICTURE OF THEIR RECEIPT ON SOCIAL MEDIA
Hey, I’m new to the group
HOLD STRONG 💪
HOLD GUYS HOLD THRU THE WEEKENDS AND COME BACK EVEN STRONGER MONDAY
FLY THAT KITE TO MOON PEOPLE
I LIKE THE STOCK
Monday same thing
I will ask with no shame for you to Venmo me 100k
Think about it
I've followed your lead to hold from $42 to $35, $82 to $60, $140 to $70, $350 to $250, $400 to $120, and I'll be holding Monday regardless of what happens
I simply don’t understand the logic for there being 60 seconds in a minute, 60 seconds in an hour, so on, so fourth
The government need, I repeat, need, to amend this so that we have 100 second minutes, 100 minute days and 100 hour days
Remember  them explicitly stating in interviews and statements that this was  about protecting you
IANAL  so I don't know whether this is legal to do
Mods, if you see this and it gets traction, PLEASE spread the word
How long do we hold
Someone commented that the shorts sold yesterday morning when the price dropped hard and are now buying back up as it raises
Chuck Norris called
So what stocks are we hitting up next week
I appreciate your giant balls and would be honored to be an autist and play Old School RuneScape with you
And I’m over here with my 1

I dont have anything invested in the market but I am here for this
So he bought in super low
BUY OR NO
This little piggy went to market this little piggy played from home this little piggy helped make history in hopes that the REALLY BIG PIGGIES CRY AT HOME
Regardless the outcome, this will go down to the history, respectfully
So last night the novice that I am I  made a buy order at market price for 20 shares- They got bought for $380 so i'm in for $7600 just to be part of history, kind of like raving in the 90's in Manchester England
Do you guys really think this can go higher 
What a way to blow $100,000
I only have 1/5 of a share in GME, all I could afford, but I'm riding coach to the moon
Is this you on twitter

This man deserves $1,000,000,000
What’s Monday mean

On robinhood 
I only use vanguard but it’s on RH as well
Think about it
Thank you for this super thorough answer
Just checked mine and it’s still good, maybe contact support
Eu também 🚀🚀🚀
Yes he did
That’s the current value of his stock, and what he would make if he sold now
So people started buying GME because hedge funds short sold them
Yup could top 500 next week
Yes seriously we like the stock and think it moves higher next week
Thanks man - From what i'm gathering the hedge funds will be trying to close it out all next week maybe into the next week
Lol i love this community, how are we all retards
You’ve taken $43 million from hedge funds in 1 month
Great work all
I swear it’s gonna triple in a week
Dont forget to rest up and enjoy the weekend and when monday comes around keep on holdin on retards
IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN
Don't believe the fake news
Puerto Rico anon here,some of these hedge funds companies were responsible for taking advantage of the island during the hurricanes
Is it too late for me to get involved in this and make them pay
This guy inspired me to buy even at 300 even though i can only afford a share and a bit
This is not financial advice
This is one of the greatest things I have ever witnessed
All in
I'm just watching on the sidelines so far, tempted to throw some beer money at it
I got 1 share but I ride with you as my savior 🚀🚀🚀🚀
You un refutable will to hold those kind of gains give me hope for humanity
DFV now needs to host seminars on the mental powers of how to buy and hold cause this is nothing like I can believe
I've put all my money into this can I get a bailout when this is over haha
It is down in after hours more I can buy Monday
Crazy, if this were any other stock
I may not know stocks

I so think it’s interesting  that when CNBC talks about the squeeze they don’t give the facts about these fund managers disclosing their short positions to try to drive the company out of business and Cohen taking over the board

Great stock squeeze or not
The more people that buy and hold the higher the value which means more money drained from hedge fund billionaires that’s distributed to the people
Yeah I mean thats simple but someone said if it hits a certain Date then they have to buy shares
Follow your gut brother <3
This is truly the best part

I'm gonna take the risk to be apart of this
Good attitude
No it’s not too late
I closed my Robinhood account a few months ago and I can't reactivate it
It's basically the same situation tho, holds
How are they valued more than Apple shares lol I'm dumb af please don't attack

I’m going to show my grandkids this comment
I was in the same boat as you, was personally late to the party and can’t afford to take the chance of a loss right now
AMC has gone up like gme man, 44% today, the charts are almost identical, idk about Nok and BB
AMC gained 53% actually and I think gme is at around 60%, so I think you may just be looking at the charts wrong, AMCs high today was 14
This man right here has convinced me to hold a position through some pretty low lows
IF HE CAN HOLD WE CAN HOLD
Well
All hail the king
I love this stock

Holding my 5 shares, no matter what
What happens if the hedge funds and whoever else made the short sales cannot cover their positions
For reference, so far, barely any of the short sales have occurred yet and yet it has already resulted in $20 billion of losses
Consider the chain of custody
In 2008, when investment banks could not afford to buy back the mortgage-backed securities that had been sold, invariably, the Federal Reserve had to intervene and purchase AIG, and then to buy trillions of dollars of the government-issued MBS that was from Fannie and Freddie
The damage I think will be whatever is the final settled upon price

Hi
I have literally 0 idea what I'm doing but I'm 3@315 on GME
Buy and hold
No financial advise, just love GME
Not the right ratio
Look at S3 partners on Twitter they are giving out updates regularly
Thank you
Take his strike price, 12, subtract it from current market price 325, multiply that by the number of contracts 500 and multiply that by 100
Thanks, forgive me to ask again, where the last 100 come from
Each contract represents 100 shares of GME
Ah that makes sense, thanks for educating me 😂
No problemo
Where do I go to buy some of the share
Lets go BB
Aight which hedge is next 😈
Sometimes when I see my tendies and play with the thought of selling, I come here and it gives me strength
What’s stopping GameStop from releasing a bunch of new shares to liquidate this surge and also dilute the share value

AMC on Monday

HOLDING
I have 2 shares 144$ avg and will never sell
HE’S STILL IN
So, if 140% of the float was shorted does that mean every share we hold is needed by the shorters to give back to market maker
I can't believe you didn't take some profit the past few days
WE should start our own hedge fund and short sell GME on the back end, screwing Melvin into infinity and beyond

Keep it rolling guys and gals
I wonder how many of these companies that are being heavily shorted by hedge funds were allowed to receive PPP loans from taxpayers, only to have to government let the billionaire hedge funds keep shorting them to the ground
DFV, I have no doubt you've been contacted by hedge funds to sell your position because you are the peoples rally cry
I love that DVF only posts the daily spreadsheet
It's smart, because it's the only thing that truly unites most of us here
If he’s still in, I’ll shag him

You have candy
But the price didnt go down and my friend doesn't want to sell me the candy back
You are very angry at me and demand I get you the candy back, no matter what the cost
If you guys hold, I’ll join on Monday with my new account outside of Robinhood
Half of my shares have a limit sell of $10,000
The other half are not for sale
Saw the news, come to moral support
Is it too late to buy GME
Keep holding, drive those greedy people who have been taking our money for 25 years, they screwed me on GNUS, but one day I am going to get em back
I missed this train and feel it's too late for me to jump in at this point

Absolutely true
Great point
I think there will be short attacks and big dips to "scare us to sell
I meant I saw the GME story, so come here to support
He spent $800,000 and can get $13
He literally just got rich over the past year
I see
Also, why are there so many people copying and pasting "we love this stock" and other phrases too
BCRX $8 a share 🚀🚀🚀🚀

We in Canada are behind AMC and GME
Hi guys
Next week

Can't Stop
So reading up on how stocks work in Singapore, naked shorts are a thing but they need to be reported and, if you can't actually give the shares when the settlement happens (like Melvin Capital) Singapore just purchases securities on their behalf, known as buying in
When I can afford it I'll invest
Respect from S
Korea 🙏
If hes still in, IM DEFINITELY STILL IN

You are a god amongst men  💎👐

Germany and UK where you at 
Just bought my first ever 25 shares
Dude, you are my hero
When do you plan to bet on BB and NOK, I am ready
How cool would it be if GameStop changes its model like Kevin was saying today
Is this the highest up voted post ever
This whole situation had me doing alot more reading,  than I would have liked,  honestly
If you're like me, you probably hate the newscaster,  that you used to think was hot, just because I didn't like her tone about WSB
When the movie about your life comes out in theatres I'm going to AMC to watch it
I may be retarded but I plan on squeezing those hedgehog balls so hard they fall off
GME is the main focus but AMC is the only option on a cheaper price
Thank you
It is an infinity squeeze
So what is that in numbers
No idea just don't expect to become a millionaire:)
They were exercised
He's had 50,000 shares for a while
So should I sell what NOK I have and just put my money in amc
I would diversify a bit
GME, AMC, BBBY, FIZZ, SIVR (it's a physical silver ETF) and B
I

The short squeez will be ended maybe thursday
I wouldn’t give an exact time frame, but I’m not a financial advisor either
You right
This is the way
NOK is a diversion
Yeah so I’m actually retarded then
So what do you suggest I do with 50 thousand Canadian dollars my friend
Buy AMC and GME and dont sell
I’m trading on AUD so I’m only getting 76 to the dollar
They are going to do great, they got a new CEO that is amazing
Not only I am ready but also my team, YOLO
It’s not about money anymore, it’s about sending the message
Bought one stock today
Monday BCRX crush um
How long we pushing this 
I couldn't fathom by having a fraction of that much cash
History being made
We need to make sure that we get fund managers bonus this year

This is the way
That's wild
I wonder how many rewards DFV has in total
This battle has shown the deep desire of every human to feel a sense of PURPOSE
Hedges are still on the hook
He's still in, I'm still in, we're all still in
Bro
You are a god
We going to have to change “Wall street” to “Reddit street”
Is that fund company going to repurchase of stocks for liquidation next week
My captains
Top post of all time
Good morning Sire I also have about 900 shares
Amazing, hold
Geeks will spend more than $20 on entry, snakkies, merch etc
GME can handle all merch and media sales since theatres rarely have any merch available for purchase even though people DEVOUR merch of every genre: movies games etc
BRING YOUR OWN CONTROLLER OR BUY A FRESH ONE FROM THE POPCORN STAND
With our forces combined we could be the future of localized entertainment
What to buy now 
I’ll sell when you sell
How does it feel to be a multi millionare
Anyone holding on to nok https://c

Eastern Euromegapoor with 1 share here
You hold, i hold
Please impregnate my wife
I think the most important thing and to remind everyone is we have to wait for the squeeze
We really don't know how high the share price will go, so we're playing chicken and actually asking for the car to hit a brick wall
And to confirm, margin trading is bad for the goal, be sure you have it disabled
Correct me if I am retarded
RH restricted to 1 share only BUY
We must hold
Question
Hold hold hold
Can europeans get in on this
Hi
Is the Silver hype real
Is the Silver crowd part of the Degenerates or just Silverbugs
I love Silver and I truly believe it's extremely undervalued and it will go much higher
Is there any realistic posibility to reach 1000$ #GME 
And am i the only one left who hold nokia 
When's the silver bandwagon starting
WE HOLD
Best buy on monday is BB

Does it matter that I can only afford to get half a share of gme or should I invest into amc that is cheaper, I want to help
According to CNBC web site, as of 1/30/2021,  106% short still outstanding in GME
Yeah everything right but what comes next
Bought 5 shares yesterday 🙌🏻💎
Hear me out
HOLD HOLD HOLD, we can take this to the mooon
Remember, they need to pay for years of market manipulation and bailouts
Ok
Good luck with that
The government might bail Bank, but not hedge fund
DFV should give us  a heads up before he sells lol
I have just bought in a little bit, and at this stage I just don’t care if I am gonna lose it anyway
Investing feels more rigged than ever now smh
I know, for them I offer my prayers
They just feel unbeatable
TLRY
Plan ahead
Oh yeah, gamma squeeze reversals go *fast
I need another drink, come to think of it
I agree with you and I have 20 additional years of perspective

Maybe war will be longer, but all battles we are wining

I am more specialezed for currency trading, but i have knowledge about stock market, i started there, and honestly this is my first EMOTIONAL trade what i did, byt also logicly , there is no way for winnig for them if we will not give it up

PROUD OF YOU ALL BUNCH OF RETARDS 🦍🦍🦍🚀🚀🚀🌝
I have my 1 share in hand
Good morning everyone, who’s still here and holding
Greetings to all 
Hi all, thought you would like to know that IG internet broker in the UK has stopped all buying in GME and AMC allowing only selling and raised the deposit for all GME and AMC holdings to 100%
What about nok
I have one share, all I could buy
HOLD EVERYTHING
If he’s still in, IM STILL IN
If he’s still in, IM STILL IN
If y'all could shoot me text next time we're set to get rich, that would be great
Okay you have my attention, 2 shares in on GME
I’m holding
When the market was tanking yesterday I saw everything falling but GME standing erect
When is GME going to do an offering
I saw your interview on WSJ
I'd be scared a hedge fund would hire a hitman against me
Think this whole move is great but come Thursday/Friday, how do those in at say $300-$400, and up, get out without losing money
As we all start selling the price will plummet quickly and it would seem a lot of little guys here might get stuck not being able to sell fast enough and lose big time
Also once we start selling won't the big guys come in and short it again
All hail DFV
Holding my one stock up north 🇨🇦
Is it too late to buy or stay away at this price
So mad I don't have money to join
Imagine going from Reddit autist to front page of wsj

Time for GME to make an acquisition to lock-in these values and secure the future of the business for us all
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again
SUITS are probably buying everything they can now to make a comeback in a few weeks and months
Google deletes negative RH reviews - let’s all now rate the Google app 😀
Wish I had that much

How about Robinhood raised a billion dollars over night

Jumped in when it was about 4
Common opinion
I don’t follow celebs, going to follow all the apes and buy some GME
SAME
I hear you
HOLD THAT MF LINE
Yeah, before taxes
Every Stock I have purchased in the last 4 years has lost money due to bad timing to be honest with you
SPCE is #2 right behind GME on the top 10 short positions held by hedge funds
You hold, we hold
So the rich got richer
I just have to say that as a day trader I am so proud of all of you
Can I still get into this game
Getting shorted for now reason
He’s still holding
Have been investing in stocks
GME is not settled yet, there is no way to settle
BCRX is a sound company
You won’t be disappointed
I just moved everything out of robbinhood
Rock on
Way  back, in the days before Reddit, there was group of people who believed  in SiriusXM (and the shorts had ravaged it to sub $1), this is where  most of my information comes from about rules for shorts and how they  work (and many could be old wives tales)
There  are currently 102 million shares of Gamestop outstanding, and a current  short interest of 61
Let's imagine a  scenario where somehow, 102 million shares get bought, and there is  still a 10 million short interest
How  would we know if retail investors had somehow eaten up all of the  outstanding shares
Thanks for any and all answers
Beyond  this, I have been laboring over buy some GME and it occurred to me that  1 share is about what it would cost to go to Universal for one day, eat  three meals out, gas (not to mention bringing my kids)
Can I post a Hoodie I made for Gamestop
The people here talking about making $/losing $ on GME don’t seem to understand what this is and why it is exciting
I’ll be buying a few shares (as much as I can afford to live without) as soon as WeBull approves my account and then I will literally never open the app again
We need to drain Wall Street swamp
And which is the best mobile app to transfer my RH ACCT
I wish I understood what calls are and how to do them

I have 2 widdle shares of GME
I would love to do that

I’M IN FROM CANADA
Worked for GameStop a long time and although not everything was sunshine and rainbows i really loved my colleagues

I recon he’s a hedger who snided in here to get you all to buy gme
Add AMC 2 
I investing retard mine is completely blown
If you've watched any of DFV's (RoaringKitty's) youtube videos you can easily tell that the ridiculous short against gme is not the only reason he invested heavily into gamestop
You are the TARD of all retards
If he's still in, I'm still in
I lost the post I needed to reply to
Bought more shares at $323, let's show those hedge fund peps the meaning of Retardedness

I sure do like this stock
Yessss let's goo
Congrats boss
Dear DFV
I still like this stock
I’m in if he is
I wish I would of made my fidelity acc like a week ago instead of just now FML
Question to the community
If DFV legit makes me a millionaire I will let him personally tattoo the diamond hands on me
Robinhood limiting buys is GME to 5 shares and AMC to 10 buys 
What if WS comes together, buys 2x shares in the long direction, squeezes themself to 100%, sells to cover the short shares plus the cost basis for the long holding
You only live once
You only live once 😀
Yes if you want to get broke
I’m already broke

Is there a website or something that compares all brokers with their pros and cons
Good enough for me
This past week it has only hit $500 after trading hours
Lol, you just somebody money
What is a meme stock
I absolutely will
Consider that AMC might 🚀 if we like that stock
I’m in the same place as you
I know nothing, I am not yet in, but I read
Im already buying amc since I figured the gme push is over and now you have to spend alot per stock to get any even though it will grow higher
Consider that AMC might 🚀 if we like that stock
Diamond hands
Anythings possible you pleb
Hedge funds have already gone long and are making money alongside retail traders
True Legend Now is just hold GME and AMC 🔮🚀
Should I buy in now or is it to late
I’m full in
Nok for life
I got tipped at $43 and I didn’t buy
Much respect for DFV, he saw this 1 year ago and everyone rallying behind him is an amazing thing to see, God bless you my man, I have 5 limit shares since they didn’t let me buy more
Omg 😳 that’s more money/wealth than I could ever dream of having
Is short interest still over 100%
I'm too poor to buy a stock that costs more than 5 dollars
Newbie question, would it not screw the shorts over more by executing a call contract forcing them to sell you the shares
Moments before death
That console refresh was really sweet
Can someone help me out here im new to the movement what should i be buying to screw hedge funds
I have an apology to make to you all
I'm the type of investor who just contributes to his 401k every week, and have lurked here for a long time for the epic gains and loss porn
However, I realized I was a paper hands little retard and I chickened out
I sold at $297 a share
I got angry, I got pissed that I chickened out, and also felt like I got bullied out of my position by blatant manipulation so I filed an SEC and FINRA complaint, but it didn't soothe my conscience
Welcome true retard, sold low and bought high
I love your honesty and your sharing
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I am interested in that $13 million in cash
Let’s hit Nokia up and some others too
HOLD 💎🤲🏼
That’s what’s up brother
I would have gotten in,but now it's too high
What is our next stock going to be
AMC
They  are going to halt trading of GME stock for a set number of days until  "things cool off"
Some  sort of CA law suit will then ensue and the "retail investors" from  WSBs will have to accept whatever price they peg for each share
Canadian mom here
Even a fraction of that money would help me pay my bills
Edit: Funny how the people are downvoting my comment just because I pointed out that I cant invest myself
IF OUR FEARLESS LEADER IS IN, I'M STILL IN

After GME we should just hit all the little stocks Robinhood shills out as referral gifts
There are so many toxic accounts/comments here from people trying to take advantage of the situation and other people with a bunch of crazy BS saying "BUY THIS BUY THAT" and you know, I hate to say it, but it's getting dangerous now
Everyone, To be successful we need to focus our attention
Right now there are just a handful of stocks that has the media attention (u know the 2 main stocks)

If the funds were smart they'd pay DFV 1 billion to sell and post about it and then everyone here would sell and then they could get out lmfao
I’m asking this here because it’s one of the top hot posts
If we can get like 6-7K per share I can pay off all my debt (I only have 4 shares)

Can someone help me understand why he's continuing to hold long calls
Don't worry guy
Is to late to get in
Anyone wanna spot me a couple hundred thousand dollars to invest in this stonk
Just addressing the elephant in the room: how is GME up 67% today when most retail investors being shut out
You guys realize if everyone who follows WSB bought 1 share on Monday we’d send this thing into orbit
Is it still worth it to buy in
I was told by RH I could only buy 1 stock of amc, any lawyers here I can send pics for lawsuit
Even though there’s time left, he should exercise those calls
I think he should execute those calls early
Watching the portfolio grow gives me proud parent vibes
Will GameStop fall or go up on Monday 
Guys
BUY GME HOLD IT
Hold GME stock baby
So
I am in Australia and can buy - should I
AMC is about to squeeze

You better not lose this money
Wow, so you invested into GME back in Nov around the 25th
He’s been invested in gme since 2019 and no hedge funds have been shorting GME since he invested
Monday we hold, forget about amc 
The only problem for this guy is once the wealthy that have billions in  GameStop start selling is that he could have had $46 million but will end up with $1000s of dollars
If they sell and he holds your looking at the new owner of GAMESTOP 🤣🤣💪💪
HOLD BOYS AND GIRLS
SOMEONE HELP ME INVEST
I say we all come up with a second play and Hold in GME

NOK isn’t even on or high on the high short interest list
GME 1 and AMC 2 last I checked
He already has 13 million in cash
You can still buy
You're late to the party and you don't know what you're doing
If you buy now you'll lose it all
You ever heard of stock bubbles
I kinda figured it was a gamble, and I couldn't afford to gamble/lose very much but it seemed asking about at least
GME & AMC for the win
Imma soon drop some more into that pretty AMC I hope
Lol they’re attacking us in every way with a meme stock like Gamestop
The price of silver is being manipulated
Bro we should attack the fiat money system next
If that’s the risk you’re willing to take then go for it, but people with this much power will not let you manipulate commodities like that
Lol, I said trillions of dollars cause it was the easiest thing to say rather than getting complex
I get what your saying but it’s just a matter of time before we are not the worlds currency anymore other countries are already planning on leaving the dollar as we speak
So how would you distribute commodities that are finite like silver
Bro the dollar is getting weaker every day there’s countries that are already planning on leaving the dollar as we speak
And what are those countries going to use as fiat
Also the market is not a free market as we’re seeing in real time
Bro I hope you understand that we are literally trying to bankrupt the corrupt ws system as we speak that’s why we’re all in this together
Dude if you bankrupt the ws system you send the entire world in a global depression that we’ve never seen before
Do whatever you think is right but at the end don’t forget we’re all in this together for the future of my kids & yours if you have any
Basically we have nothing to lose & all to gain from all of this
We here bby
To expensive to get in at this point
Hedgefund 🛸🛸🛸
What next after GME
Which stock will make us all millionaire
BCRX it's been posted
BCRX Monday Boys
The 15k I'll make from this is the most money I'll ever see in my life at once
What is with Varta
Woah my hand are paper
We have already won
Let’s do AMC Lady’s and gents
Give me a hand with SNDL
I thought AMC was next, as it’s 2nd on the high interest list
I just got here
The most important thing is that we can't stop with GameStop
We have the power, we just need to use it and keep using it, and not let the movement die down
The only question now is, what's next
This ship has already sailed- looking for the iceberg
How bout AMC
BCRX Is the next batter up
Dumb question perhaps but how will we know when DFV exits
I spent my  life savings ($340) on placing an order for 1 share of gamestop stocks this weekend, I will probably die homeless on the street but so did many many others that wallstreet fked over so at least i died fighting
Consider AMC
Im new boys, what is the 16,000,000 “call” row
Edit: A word
Remember the addage: What goes up must come down
Not to be Debbie downer (and I'm not the smartest guy in the room here either), but April 16 is a long ways away
You can sell options any time
Yes I understand that, dude
Excuse me for being hostile, but let me just break it down for you cause this got out of hand (On my end), But when someone states the obvious I kinda get annoyed
Yes
Gentlemen, this is a casino
How do you think DFV sold his contracts for 10mill in Jan 15, when his contracts expired the same day
There must be a stupid amount of pressure on you to not sell this
Dont let this consume you and feel like youre letting anyone down either way
There's no "morally wrong" move
Almost $14M in cash
Hey, go away
Not here
Yeah I may be retarded but I'm not retarded
Unfortunately, many here are
Bro, most of us realize what’s going on here
You're spending $600 on the weekend
My advice is not for you - I'm talking to the newbies seeing all this hype, seeing a guy with $30M in, and deciding to put serious cash in this POS
Yes actually i sometimes spend $600 on the weekend
I can smell the hedge fund on you
Only calling me a politician would be a worse of a slur
The thing is, it's not about making money anymore, it's about making the HF's lose money
Imagine thinking that every other hedge fund isn't mouthwatering over how much money it's going to make off the collapse of just one
Sounds good, let them all eat eachother
Oh they will, which means you're just gonna replace Melvin Capital (which is relatively small) with a handful of even richer hedge funds who profited from their loss
What about dodge right now
New trader
Thanks and good luck
You are a hero
If this website and it's users can get better organized and purchase stock based on reasonable data, rather then on hatred, jealousy, emotion and revenge it would be dangerous, as Wall Street has noticed
Listen melvin, im not selling my GME
You have no idea what you're talking about
What was all this serious research
OP has a YouTube channel with DOZENS of videos explaining what was happening with GME and why he was going to invest in it since 2019, check the posts in this sub, all the information is around
We like the stock
What an idiot 
I don't mean to piss in your Wheaties but you are all talking about how much $ your making by holding the stock
Honest question- could this guy even liquidate that large of a holding in options without taking a big hit in price
Ok thanks
What's an exit strategy
If you've at least doubled your money cash it in and be happy man having a house is a lot better than maybe making another $10,000 but probably losing it all
He's already cashed out over $16M he knows what he's doing
Because its not about an extra 10,000
Cool, hope you got a nice and early
Realistically how much do you think you'll make
This guy cant be serious
Oh man, youre in for a lesson
I’m hoping to see BB STOCK EXPLODE TO $300 per share 
Dude, BB is a diversion
U mean when will this skyrocket to the point where everyone does this
People shouldn’t be investing their life savings in it then should they
WE HOLD
What’s NEXT
I'M STILL IN
IF HE'S IN I'M STILL IN
Oh, i wish I knew this earlier
What happens to my shares if Robinhood shuts down
If there would be a correction on the price of silver to it’s true value you wouldn’t have to carry that much more than the change you carry in your pocket & also we could open up credit unions that would be backed by silver or gold or whatever we decided it would be it doesn’t have to be just silver it could be other commodities as well
I don’t want to be rich
What will be trading strategy
Go all in
Yes all in Check the thread it's been posted
Posted by who
Check stock twits screen shots or look down the thread it's been posted by WSB moderator
The moderator for wall sreet bets read down the thread
You will find all the info read down the thread it was posted by the moderator
We are talking about everyone becoming a millionaire and ppl are bothering him with 1 share of GME 🤣🤣
Yes 😂😂 😂😂 it's out there trust me BCRX by the moderator go look on stock twits there are screen shots if you can't find it on here with all this GME chatter good luck make that money
We’ll make crazy money buying up travel stocks
Each one of those April contracts are worth like 30k
Well then, you're clearly overpaying for that BangBros sub
You mean the individual traders who own a whopping >16% of total GME stock
Don't you think they would have done it by now if they were going to
The man actually likes the company & the stock
Perfect thanks great explanation
Not the person I'm replying to
Is there a way to confirm this
I actually sort of did, as a college student i kept track of OP's posts and decided to put down 20K, a week later i still haven't cashed out but i have enough to pay my student loans, my mother's house and get myself a Tesla
Luck, no luck, doesn't really matter
Yeah go for it mate
Nor would you be
Dude has 55k shares
Could anyone please explain me how his 500 calls equal 15,976,250
What’s next
I wish I could have held with you guys❗Next Time I Want To Be Apart❗❗
Good for you and I’ll do a lot to help poor people
I’m trying to get in rn but robinhood is taking 19 years to approve my account 😪😪
Retard looking to dip in the gravy train
NEVER TOO LATE UNLESS BUYING AT A $1000 MAYBE
How much higher will this stock go
If he’s stillin, I’m stillin
Monkey see Monkey do
Can I apply to you for a scholarship 😂
Im holding strong, but don’t the hedge funds make money in volatile situations
I have a buy set up for opening Monday AMC
Balls of steel
What’s everyone opinion on rycey Rolls Royce, going to buy 10k since robinhood restricted it also
I shorted right before it jump
Yo, I know almost nothing about finance
Do we hold
Was this a joke
One-post short bots
Russian trolls trolling Redditt to ensure a stock market manipulation
IDEX < is next I can feel it 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Congratulations big money
SELL
Does $GME will reach 1000
Sir may I please suck your cock
I sir, declare you the most dead n side investor/retard
Can i plz cop a million
Hold and buy AMC
I'm a little slow I don't get it

HOLD THE FORT
Can we do Nio now
I lost out on nok 😢couldn’t afford gme once it took off 😫
Prudent risk management would say sell some
Can always rebuy lower
I have absolutely no idea how stocks work but I'd like to feel included in something
Wow
When will I be able to post again
Is bb still the stock to hold
Uhm I need to make a little money
Yeah okay, now let's see what happens when you try to sell 50k shares at that price
If he’s still in, you all should now sell
You all will be crying in a month
Show that AMC update
I love the stock
What if they offered 50 million shares with each at $1000
Bruh
Congrats on achieving what you have
If you're cool with this, then fine, but make sure you're doing things for you, and not because of external pressure from people you don't know
Go sell it all and retire
He already sold $13
Is it too late
Same kind of person 
I'm sorry if I sound dumb or anything but has this guy become the world's richest person
WHAT STOCK IS NEXT EVERYONE
When is the next ride
Maybe its a rookie question
Seems this is a patience game and for now they will be mainly suffering from fees and interests till the people automatically give up and start to cash out their wins
Patience is the key here and it will blow in their faces once they start buying out
Again I am a rookie and don’t understand what the hell  is ongoing
Yesterday in wsb telegram voice chat the most common opinion was buy back must happen until next Thursday
This is not a financial advise, just rumours
Silver on Monday 
Hi, guys look at odonate therapeutics, ODT, 94% of the shares are short, possible new candidate for WSB 👌👍
Newbie seeking knowledge
Any advice will be much appreciated
Please sell it now or you eill loose all this money in the end
Melvin bot stfu
Nope i am not
Don't you dare to mention the f-word in my retard fund, you're fired
I'm not talking about Melvin Capital, I'm talking about everyone else, like BlackRock, who are UP $3B
Ah, thanks
You can’t trade with robin hood
Not at the moment you can’t but it has to come back at some point 🤷🏻‍♂️
ITS NOT INVESTING IF YOUR SHORTING CLOWN
Sounds like you should go all in on gourds
Nah man I’m wondering what’s going on
You are the luckiest man alive
No
True, but 43M would be an even nicer cushion
Great question
Nothing is next yet
Do you know if this works with stash or should i move my life savings to robinhood
Bro the only stash I know of is my weedbag
Not financial advice
Anyway whatever its true or no
Silver is the big one
Not yet
You know the SEC is going to come after you
Cash hasn’t moved
Has he closed any positions yet
Is it still worth joining
SU-CA or SU-TO
At commodity prices this should be at 40-50, instead it sticks around 22
He wisely already cashed (sold - profit taking) way more than 20% of his holdings in GME, these 14 million in cash leaves him with a net profit of 13,75 million no matter what happens to the stock
You idiots, keep increasing your holdings of GME instead of profit taking part of trades (so you have a cash net profit) and hoping for the moon and you will be left wondering why you bought high and were the last dummies holding shares when the correction arrives
By holding, he no longer risk any of his Equity, as a matter of fact his equity have gone effectively from 50k to 14 million (realized)
Rock Hard 💎 🙌🏼
I’ve liked GME and all but I’ve made my nut
You should do the same with the cruise lines - ccl, RCCL, etc - that bss will be destroyed soon
What is max GME squeeze price
What is max price GME 
SPCE is #2 right behind GME on the top 10 short positions held by hedge funds
If you are interested in investing in a Canadian cannabis company msg me

You are the truth and the light
ALL GREEN BABY
Is AMC worth the play
NOK next week
So uhh guys
He has a YouTube channel, Roaring Kitty, if you wanna see what kind of person he is
We like billionaires
Is this whats happening with BB too
No, what's happening with GME is a once in a decade event, nothing else is moving like this
Would i be too late in getting in rn
Pay attention to user DFV
Yeh, Melvin and the shorters
What we buying
GME is the primary stock
If you pay my $12k car loan i'll put all of my money into this
Reach down the back of your pants with 4 fingers you clown there's your play
It's only money mate
It's the blindly following and having no clue what going on
Can anybody give me advice on the stock market what should I invest my money for a small time investor would mean the world to me
Go to the stocks or investing subreddit
Right
Great name brother
I think it's spelled bought :)
The King has spoken
What is YOLO
TO will get to $20 in a week
TO
Should cash the hell out
Is there a chance he can't cash out because nobody can buy
I m here as an investor who has lost whole of my economy because of those big hedge fund
I m here
Looks like he sold more of the calls for some weekend tendies
My shares expire today
Look at MAllinckrodt
Actualy the share is at 0,50 $ and the real value could be at 30-60-100 $
Buy Mallinckrodt and we will be in history and text books economy
Is it too late to invest in GME
BABA EARNINGS ON TUES MORNING PREMARKET
Why hasn’t anyone tried to get Nokia going that’s global
He should sell
What can they come after him for
I don't know, I think if they try to come after people on reddit, they're gonna wish they hadn't
He closed half his options
Elaborate
Infinite since there are not that many stocks
I get $GME attraction, pissed I missed on it, however, $AMC makes me wonder what will happen with them as the pandemic rages on, is anyone going to movies anymore
The vaccine will be rolled out in under a year
Exactly, y'all got played
But he hasn't sold yet, so right now he's still just a retard
You'd be plain stupid not to sell right now
Unless of course this was pocket change for him
I don't disagree
Can you drop me a link where to buy
Actually theres a big post right now, How to buy GME above limits
Thanks
Appreciate your time
Nice
Your loss not mine
Got any advice then I only have about $500 to Invest
I would but I have very little money to spare on something I was able to make $14 off of GameStop so far
You Only Live Once
He cashed out $16M two days ago, he ain't dumb
My point exactly
Shares don't expire
People are saying Melvin capital exited amd recouped the stocks they lost
Monday amc
AMC is the stock to buy
What so you comrades about B*den unwinding all these sweet gainz
READ THIS PLEASE
What stock y’all going to do next lol
Thinking not selling some today might not be a good thing when people have an entire weekend to work against the stock price
Guys I'm losing hope for 1k ngl
I don’t invest, can someone explain this picture to me
I’m probably the exact type of person who shouldn’t be on here asking these questions but
You’ll miss your opportunity for a financial freedom stop teasing your luck
Melvin is that you
So $32 million from a $750k investment
Is that how this shows
He started 17 months ago with 50k
Bruh wtf  whats so special about this post, tbf I'm really drunk right now but I don't see whats so special about this one, like I've been following this now for a couple of days but what does this post mean
I really hope you’re kidding but if not you’re retarded and you can stay, you’ll fit in lol
Next Friday GME will be nowhere near current value
DFV
If you want to inflict real pain to the bankers, like JP Morgan, ride the  🌊 with the silver surfers
We are all in this together
Seegene, the protagonist of covid 19diagnosis, is undervalued due to short selling
Seegene's share price is currently declining through futures sales and short selling, despite a foreign ownership of more than 20%
Seegene's 2020 sales are well above billion usd and operating profits are even more than 60%
Also, Per is 10% under
Please help us
DUMP DUMP DUMP
I heard something in the news where the head of nasdaq basically is demonizing Reddit because of the exposure of this situation that did not swing in the favor of the rich
Nobody else saw any of that this week
Can we not coordinate a 50% selloff to capture some profit and reposition with more shares and give some people a better opportunity to buy in
No one is coordinating anything here, it's just people sharing opinions
Can a all share the opinion that a brief sale and reinvestment would be amazing
Cash out dummy
I just got a robin hood account what do I do next
How is this any different than the wall street guys
Curious, at what point do you think you'll cash out
Awesome
I was here guys
Bro please sell soon
Retards = Stock Insurrectionists  according to Main Street Media
Should I buy into AMC
Like gme but not like gme
I’m completely new to stocks, still barely understand it
I (want to) have a life I want to live, I’m facing going uninsured and not being able to afford my medications in less than a year
I don’t care about investing for RETIREMENT
I want to be able to afford my own place, so I can feel more confident to get into dating women, starting while I’m still in my frigging 20s
The hell with retirement if I’m going to kill myself in a year or so anyway
I already missed out on flipping PS5s and XBOX Series Xs, not this too
Should i sell my AMC, BB, and BBY
Someone who was able to afford to throw down 700k on a meme stock wasn’t poor to begin with
Idk when he started with 50k, it may or may not be true but I haven’t seen a source
This image shows that he paid $700k+ for his 50k shares
You just go back in his submissions
Sure but the firms are playing with other people’s money
He invested 50k dollars in September 2019
You give me anxiety just cash in already
I lost 7k on GSPC because of all this
I'm out of work and was too stupid, broke and essentially chicken to listen to everyone on here re: GME to begin with
That being said, hook a brother up
Lol he just inspected element in the browser and changed the values
Clearly a scam by the reptilian elite to steal your tendies
Then I guess I need to get reedy for a new heart attack
Since the day, week and month are over I'm ok with you autistic retards giving me some rewards
Great work today holding the line and pushing it higher
So he always updates us at 4 PM EST
I mean
Wow, one minute in and this place is already packed like the profits we’ll make on GME
I joined today on principal guys
Edit 2: THIS COMMENT THREAD IS ALSO ACCEPTING ONE SHARE GANG
EDIT 3: MY INBOX IS EXPLODING
AMC looking mighty nice to buy right now
Can we move on to SLV
Eat the rich
BNGO seems promising rn, think it could be the month of bingo
Can we focus on BB, AMC, and NOK
How does this make him better than hedge funds lol
SELL
Poor millionaires
Thank you
There he is he’s back lol welcome back buddy
Ah its 3 in the morning prb shouldn't, but anyaway has any other development happened over the last few hours that I've m8ghtive missed
Nah it finished the day at $325
Now I’m bored at home every one in my house is sleeping so I’m trying to figure out how Reddit works with all this karma and upvotes
Oh shot you’ve been on here for 2 years
Bruh don't worry, you'll learn as it go along, basically reddit is just made up of a bunch of communities with  number of different topics, look up your own interests and subscribe to the subreddits your interested in and enjoy
Maybe the covid19 diagnosis market is more saturated than you think
Make your money on GME and do what you want to help humanity
This post clearly shows that you weren't listening or following what's going on
Robinhood is limiting the number of shares you can buy rn
I just want to make 5,000 dollars after all this is over
Cash out when the squeeze happens
I sort of regretfully cashed out a majority of my shares yesterday at the 415 before the huge dip
That's okay
Intend on buy anther 10-20 shares depending what monday premarkets are gonna be at
Dont put your rent money in
But I want to live on the moon
Never play with money you can't afford to lose
Tell that to CNN and his entire Reddit history confirming he held this even when losing a ton couple months back
Are you making a joke, or just one of the noobs that joined this week
SILVER is the next Gamestop
Convinced a lot of people to sell today

Wrong
Everyone is holding AMC and GME
Because they want to, nothing's going to happen with those stocks
I hope you ended up doing well
I don't like your technical, sir
Mostly, I just try to avoid decisions leaning heavily on technicals over extremely thin volume
Btw slap fight challenge stands, as a matter of honor

Or we can keep squeezing and I'll age 5 years an hour watching my portfolio fluctuate tens of thousands of dollars a minute and then have a meteor crash back down to 16 and shorts win and retail lose
Wow imagine the amount of GameStop stonks people could buy if they didn’t splurge on Reddit  awards

Keep holding headband daddy
What can I say
USE YOUR MONEY ON MORE SHARES NOT REWARDS
This post at the end of the day alone helps me be more confident about my decision to not sell through the day
I know I'm a schmuck who got in to this thing way too late and there are actual finance pros who are making a killing with this but if someone is able to hold this much with so much confidence, it gives me some confidence too, that maybe it was a good decision to risk it all for another day
Have limit buy orders for $200, $160, $120 after hours in case they try to pull a fast one down to $115
Next week is gonna be crazy
No wonder all known photos of DFV are of him sitting down

Opportunity to buy 100 shares at 12 each
So why do the 500 $12 calls have a lower value than the 50000 shares
Because they aren't the same thing
If a $12 call is an opportunity to buy 100 shares wouldn’t 500 $12 calls be equal to 50000 shares
Plus the cost paid for the options themselves
It’s the man, the myth and the legend who holds the top post on r/outside

Dude btw delirium tremens is a helluva beer
I have my suspicions that the overall market weakness this past week has been driven by GME (and other) shorts making margin calls
Could it be that instead of covering their GME positions they've been liquidating ACTUAL EQUITY
Could they really be that stupid
As soon as I have enough to buy a share I’m in
I got caught in the Reddit frenzy and know very little about investing and the stock market, can someone traslate the image for me

GameStop is a value buy
Don't tell us about market "fundamentals" and PE ratio and all that blah blah blah
By your logic, non-profit organisations are worthless
You know what's more fundamental than your "fundamentals"
We are but the sum of our choices
You've been shorting Tesla based on your "fundamentals" and getting it wrong this whole time because you can't see that we're simply voting for a future of clean energy
If you can't support us, just stay neutral

We like that stock

How did DFV see that they were shorting the stock so much
I'm asking because I would like to learn how to pay attention to that in the future
HOLD GME AMC
New here
Execute your calls and get stock instead
What site is this
Thou shall hold - Jesus Christ
Your calls expire on my birthday could I has 1
Am I too late to the GME if I didn't invest
DFV could probably double his money just by opening a cameo account at this point :)

Well done gents
Got my 1 gme and 10 amc on RH at the dip
No, AMC extended share levels and are only shorted at 60% GME shorted at over 100% AND have less shares
They only let me buy 1 share of gme
AMC extended shares and is only shorted 60% GME has less shares, shorted over 100% and has all the hype
That didn't answer my question, but thank you for your reply
Sorry, you're right
It means he bought a call that expires on April 21 for the quantity and price listed
I missed this one, but ill follow u anywhere
If he's in I'm still in
I just subscribed to your YouTube and intend on destroying that like button player
Hold the doooooooooor

Gill, Is it too late to jump in on gamestop and make some money
Impressive
I think about the fact that even $5,000 would change my life lmfao, what would someone even do with that much profit
Hi does anyone know the best site to make money on
So the $12 call means that he bet the price would be at least $12 by April 16th, correct
Stay in there king
That’s sooooooooo much money
Just signed up with fidelity, next pay day I’m jumping in boys
Quick question because I know literally nothing
No
Got it

Why you buy that much in April on gamestop
Strange how when I was looking at the pic all I could hear in my head was Atari teenage riot
THE PEOPLE NEED SOMEONE LIKE YOU TO BELIEVE IN
If he's in I want him inside me
I'm in a bad financial position but bought one share for the cause
I apologize if this is a stupid question, I don't know a lot about stocks, but is this picture saying that this guy now has thirteen million dollars that is his

How much do we have to bribe Robinhood to disable the SELL button
As I sit her tonight, I hold a picture of DFV in my mind
Imagine for a second that the future looks different
To think that today, we try to do this
Now imagine a time where this tax doesn’t exist
The tipping point has happened thanks to DFV
And where did this tipping point come from
This is the beginning
HOLD like your life depends on it
I'm holding up on to the 🚀🚀🚀
Apes together strong

Riding this rocket to the moooooooooooooon
Reddit should be sponsoring DFV, considering how much money he is making them
You need cages to hold this mans diamond balls 📈📈💎🙌
I’m worried the squeeze was yesterday But they stopped it from happening
Not selling until 5000$ per share
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN

It’s about time social media worked for the “nobodies” of this world
Congrats on your hard work guys 
Basically seems like a “The rich keep getting richer” strategy
PS: My pre-emptive ode to the academic 'researcher' who curates this pile as an academic dataset & tries to milk tenure out of it
My retarded friends and I gather around about 4:30 everyday waiting for the post
RH canceled my call twice
So I think I made a big mistake
Shout to the little guys
If he’s in, I’m still in
Just like Mom &Pops across america in 2008 and just like Lemans Brothers, I want to see some blood veggie this is over then we can sell
There’s a stock that has been manipulated so bad its gone bankrupt
Hold hold and NOC,  down down, fall down, fall down
Friend keeps saying it’s a practice account
Guys should we be buying some SPCE for when we go to the moon
Now that attention and spotlight is on you, I hope your staying safe retard

I nominate DFV To be bull gang supreme commander
I've just gone through and checked every one of these GME monthly update posts and I am truly in awe of how this man just held and held even after losing approximately 14mil at one point
I don’t know what’s bigger; your gains or your balls

Power to Joe six pack
Hedge Fund arrogance is being obliterated by average Americans
Days of Elites getting away with murders are over
Everything we are doing is legal,ethical and moral
Robin-hood committed a crime against common man and they will pay for it
Time to get rid of Satanic Hedge Funds
Do you need a babysitter
I am a little problem to understand this table
It is related to GME stock earnings

So how is gamergate going friends and memes
If I get out of this alive, I’ll go to Gamestop every Sunday and buy myself a pretty game

Blue horseshoe loves GME
Ayy it’s back up
Deep
VAAAALLLLUUUUEEEEE
What is it like being a god
This dudes story is now so much bigger than just him already
Totes love this stock
Yes it’ll crash
So is the idea just to crash them into the ground
Or will people here still make good money in the process
The idea isn’t to crash gme to the ground, just the hedgefunds and brokers manipulating the market
Yes that’s what I meant, not GME and AMC but the hedge funds and brokers
The second row is his gambling addiction
That’s his avg cost
How'd this man get 50k shares at 14
He bought 50k shares when gamestop was cheap
Still though, this mad lad has bought 50k shares, even at their least expensive (March 2020) he would have had to have invested 200k
Give me some haha
Is Robinhood not even accepting applications 
Is it too late to get in on the action
Can we get him a special flair “diamond hands”
Is it too late for NOK
You absolute god
I like the stock
If this doesn’t give GME the push to interstellar space, nothing will

DFV made 46 million dollars and that really pissed him off
I went on Reddit once, like a lot of years ago, and couldn't figure out the point of it
New acct/member but I’ve been fully retarded for my whole life

BCRX $8 a share cheap as hell Mooooooonday 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🤣
Check out BCRX- $8 a share and hugely short
Sorry what do you mean by BCRX
What’s BCRX
I bought a share of hope too
APES TOGETHER STRONG
Amazing
Someone make this retard Treasure Sekratary or Fed Chareman
It would take a exponential increase to kill it and the exponent is higher on their end
At this point would buying gamestop stock just be for the principle of the millionaires losing money
This journey is a great effin inspiration
I attempted to buy Game Stop stock, could not
I hope everyone gets it
My friend was wondering if she should buy the share premarket or during open
HOLD
IF HE HOLDS I HOLD 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Just saying this is a dead end although they need a wake up call it can’t persist

Since 1991, I have witnessed the nefarious acts perpetrated by these hedge funds
Absolute legend

We like the stock :)
Anyone know how many shares GameStop own of themselves
We believe
I’ll fit rt in here it’s just like where I’m from
Yeah go dude
What’s chart say DFV
I’m only two stocks deep as I quite can’t afford much else as a college student
You at some point are strengthening their position
Won't stop can't stop GAME STOP
HOOOOOLLLLLLDDDDDDDDDDD
Made up for yesterday, HOLD TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON 💎👐🚀🌛🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌛🌛🌛
In case anyone needs memes to explain what's going on: [https://youtu
DFV stimulus checks, anyone
I could only afford a fractional share, but I am holding onto it to say that I was here when millions of Davids took on Goliath
I’m not selling 
My first day and trying to wrap my head around all this
I can fell another squeeze around the corner
Absolutely legendary
You are an inspiration
I'm new and Im loving it
Thank you for your service

Can someone tell me a good app or site to use when buying stocks
STONK TO THE MOON 
He likes the stock
Lol, I didn't have the money to buy even one share I'm so poor
LEGEND AMONGST LEGENDS
I wish I understood any of this
I was reading his comments from GME post in 2019
Buy gme 
Not really sure how to go about that
Look in AppStore for a broker or trading app where you can buy stocks
If the hold works and people keep buying and the stock hits 1k then you could very well make a profit
Where can I buy stock for it
BCRX $8 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Wow definitely no bot here
I’m still all in on amc at $18
I'm all in on their next movement
Watching AMC to the moon ✋🚀🚀🚀🌔
Good
Well that’s all good for you
Nice to see you almost entirely recovered yesterday's loss
WE LIKE THE STONKS
I guess people think it’s still going higher
THIS IS THE WAY
I would honestly understand if you sold right here, you could live comfortably the rest of your life without ever having to work
This is a blitzkrieg not a something to do forever
I wonder how many naked Calls were sold against GME
Crbp or pltr
HOLLLLLLLD
How was it possible to get GME at $
I don't know anything about the STONK market, but this sir is impressive
I hope that’s not on RH
I’m too poor to buy anything but I told mom and nana to buy shares and they did
Stop, stop, I can only get so hard
Do you like stock
How do I participate
KEEP ON HOLDING TILL THE MOON 🚀
I’m just looking and loving the feeling
Hold cause squeezes can take longer than 1 day
They have to pay billions
Right
This stock looks quite neat
We love the stock
Keep going brother Deep 👏🏾
Im not autistic enough to understand
WE LIKE THE STOCK
Gotta say I've been following only since jan 5 but this is amazing
You guys are awesome
Still time to buy
If he's in im still in
Not to mention the Indirect causation that would  undermine your position
News On CNBC (Fast Money); Robinhood is limiting buy orders 👎
They dropped their limited buy options from 5 to 2 to 1 yesterday
I wish DFV would post another stalk that is cheap, i bet it would blast off as well
So we all with each other now but when time comes to sell where y’all stand
Leaders lead by example
I heard my wife tell her boyfriend and their kids that we were going to make them rich
If he is still in, I am in
So cool for parading your wealth
Be more like Chad
GAME FACE, BRO
I’m down, but not out and will not cave 💎🙌🏽 buying more Monday
I bought the holy trinity today GME AMC and NOK
NOK is a diversion
Why ru still here
Can I have about tree fiddy
I like the stalk
I may lose all my money, but it’ll be nothing compared to what Wall Street loses
This is history in the making
Noob question, since most of brokerage are preventing more buying of selective stocks
If these brokerages allow only 1 share to be purchased, how come pennies go to the dollar land
Still hold
I was so close to throwing a few bucks at GME a few weeks ago but I didn’t and I’m so mad now
Long live the king
Ok this might be a retarded question but why aren’t you buying call options instead of the stock itself
See if he sells do any of you think his position is so big it will cause the price to go down
MARTY MCFLY IS THAT YOU
I think at this point a substantial amount of his net worth will stem from Reddit Awards xD
There are some amazing over sights
Next week
Someone tell me am I too late to buy stocks in GameStop
What plattform do you trade on
Thought he had balls 10 months ago, but now this is just insane
I'm just observing but I've learned more about stocks in 4 days than in 53 years
This feels like justice
Exactly
Here's to being a part of history for so many reasons *clink*
Clink clink my friend
I'm trying to figure it out too
So appreciate this movement ~ group
Thank you
Are these good to just buy
There are good to hold for a week or so
Ok awesome
He used options
He's got both
That looks like it’s doing not good though 😂
DFV looks to be on Etrade
I see
Do you have any recommendations
Etrade Or TD
I like squeezing Blackberries, better than Lemons for lemonade
Let’s make AMC next
How did you guys get all that money to buy in the first place
Any advice to alternate of Robinhood for stock trading
I wonder how this guy must feel being the leader of an entire movement that is taking on billion dollar hedge funds
Sleepin on em
As a lurker on WSB I used to love you guys just for the memes
Now, I just love ya
WOOOOOHOOOOO
I'll literally pay you to teach me how to do this😊
I feel like every comment in this thread needs to be read like they're yelling it over a hurricane and I can't get enough of it
Need NOK to catch fire
Is it too late
He is literally MY CAPTAIN
Feelin that FOMO
States sponsor lotteries, what it is the harm
You can look up the outstanding not won prices and them make , more or less an educated guess to improve your chances
Stock are a lottery governed by the "big boys" let you or not loose your money playing their game
I like this game better  :)
Can someone explain how long we’re supposed to hold for
Ok what I miss everybody sold out
HOLDING GME 🚀
The people’s captain 🚀💎

Shout to Robinhood to staying true to their mission of making the market vastly available
Thank you Robinhood for giving me a free share of GME from all the commercial marketing you did adverting that share was on you
Wait
Oh, look it's making me money
There is no significant short interest in NOK
It was a diversion
You’re in
Unfortunately I’m not in
Remind me
But you're still on time man

Mesmerizing his gains, with a zerodha account at hand
Meanwhile I've lost almost everything I put in it :(
I wish I knew about this before hand and bought enough to at least make even $50,000 to get out of what feels like crippling debt that I’ll never pay off
U gonna give back to the reddit community when u done
If you hold then I’ll buy , and I’ll will hold with you
Wow
I appreciate that you dont even broach the fact that you were doxxed by the media today
WSB has brought the country together on a political level for the first time in years
I don’t own any GME shares but I have enjoyed watching this unfold over the past few days on the news and watching this sub over the past few weeks not knowing what was about to explode
We like the stonk
I invested $150,000
This stock will be a major millionaire maker as they are covering the recreational and medical fields
Most importantly, they did not sold out to the Tabaco or alcohol industries

Is it too late to hop on the space ship I just setup my account
Isn’t this guy going to jail
First post on WSB and on reddit for that matter
Yes some may have to sell a little to finance the options execution but ultimately this is the fastest way to get the stock to jump to 1000
How the hell do you have so much guts

Oh my gourd
You are a complete & utter legend
Im so stoked about what is going on
That said, as usual I found out about it way too late
Raping these cats
At the moment, those who keep purchasing and holding Game Stop shares are in the driver's seat
There are three things that make diamonds, heat pressure and time, just a bit longer
Hold 🚀🚀🤘🏻🤘🏻
Absolutely insane
Do you go to work each day like this isn’t even there
So your WSJ interview
Think its too late to buy in and make a profit
Just checking if I have the karma to talk stonks
My petty single digit stock holdings may have little impact in the grand scheme of things
I LIKE THE STOCK

Further, it is hilarious to see the people ripping this man's position apart on his early posts
MAKE DFV ADMIN OF ALL OF REDDIT
You sir are a living legend
On a side note, I fear the ramifications of this Main Street VS Wall Street war will be the SEC creating regulations requiring a minimum of x funds in your brokerage account before being allowed to transact, simply to prevent us little folk from being able to do this again
Lets do it

If u same early u make money if u come late u loose
Think about someone who sees the news, gets caught up in the moment and decides to buy 20 shares
February 1st  GME  will announce a stock offering from there tearsury to raise capital  and if that price is around where it is now  or higher it will create a base price and the Stonk won't drop below that
This is not true at all, literally everything you said here is inaccurate

Hello guys new investor here is it to late to get on the rocket ship for GME/AMC
Hi guys, its too late to get in
Man I wish I would have jumped in sooner
To pay off my mortgage
I had gamestock a few weeks ago before it went up
I was going go get bk in at $36 but my broker advised me not too
Boy do i wish i didnt listen
He has sold a bunch ppl
Never in the field of human investing has so much been owed by so few to so many
This will end badly for many
Bulls make money Bears make money and PIGS get SLAUGHTERED
Tell me if I’m reading this wrong, but do you have multiple million dollars in GME and are still holding
How many champions will be wiring money to other brokerage accounts Monday to buy more $GME instead of selling
I’m glad I joined this lol
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE WITHDRAW OUR MONEY OUT OF THE BANKS AND HOLD CASH FOR A WHILE
Has anybody tried to withdraw they account in cash the bank usually set a limit or give you a check “for safety” I tried and was told a limit or wire transfer to another financial institution

BCRX is getting mentioned as a possible squeeze for Monday
Is this going to happen to amc
The feeling you get being a 15 year old with no bank account yet seeing all that missed money
Why hold shares why not cash out
Am I right to understand these calls initially cost 100$ 
I think when he bought the call, the stock is probably at $4, so going back to $12 was unlikely at that time
Yes, when he bought the call option the stock is probably at something like $3, so going back to $12 was unlikely and thus a low premium of $
Do you think it’s too late I get into GameStop
Yea and no
If there are many people coming in and the ones already in are holding then perhaps there’s a chance
Hey I'm late
Our True diamond handed king
Is NOK even a part of this resurgence
I think the short float is rather low on NOK 
What is the realistic all time high for GME
I'm going to ask a stupid question cuz I'm a retard when it comes to options
Like how long we gonna keep teabagging melvin by keeping it at 300
You spoiled little brats are going to lose your shirts
Silver for this year, Palantir for a long term hold but wait till March to buy
He should do a live video showing what he is holding and if he has sold anyone
I'm trying to join now but have no clue how to even begin
Mentioned here too five days ago as one of the 39 stocks Goldman Sac think is overvalued [https://www
True in an academic sense but hold my beer
Silver or Palantir
Wow ok thank you
Oh i see , thanks
Yes, each call option contract is 100 shares of stock
Cheers for explaining
A lot of money still to be made even if you buy Monday
How do you know when they start closing out their shorts 
You don’t
Check out S3 partners data bro
The market is a gamble just like a casino
You’ll see the share price increase dramatically when they close their positions
I agree
There was an article yesterday talking about how 10,000 share blocks were being traded
Opportunity is open once the stupid bar on how many shares you can buy is lifted
Dump your 401k right now and get back at us
You shouldn’t put your life savings in, only way you can afford to possibly lose
People in reality only care a out themselves and their families
Nah, it's in the billions, but so is NIO etc
Looks like short % of float is only like 1% to 2% according to Yahoo
Idk I have to check
Yes, but I wonder why it only costs $
It’s because the average price adjusts from the original position I think
Ok, the stock price when he bought the option must had been like $3, so going to $12 strike was unlikely at the time
I think it was closer to $5 and they were on the cusp of bankruptcy so yeah nobody ever thought it would ever get back to 12
RH was only allowing people to buy two shares
Lol we ran the clearing firms out of floating capital to facilitate share purchases man, give the clearing firms their T+ 2 days to settle(they have to follow that rule too) and it will go back to normal
Follow the sandale - UUUUOOOOLLLDDD
Do you still recommend GME a buy

Great  job
Is it to late to get into the game
Do you want us to continue buying GME or are we just at a holding stage only
If / When we eventually sell the stock, how quickly will it happen- or will the $ decline
You won't live to cash any of that :)
This is the best thing that could happen to Gen Z after having to accept $30 for a used console each time a new one came out

What app can I use to buy GameStop stock
Are we still holding BB and NOK 
So many pretty awards🙄
I sold 500,000 puppy coins three weeks ago locking in $100 profit 😜
What if GameStop makes a deal with the hedge fund to take money from them to save them
It didn’t let me buy
Held GME for 5 yrs in the 80s-  lost patience-shoulda seen me scrambling to see if there was any shares left
If you all were smart you would scale out half your profits
That's some crazy options gain
Can someone tag me in the link with peoples life storyies
Please want somebody who's been blessed blessed me with a puppy or the money to go out and buy my own thank you and all prayers to the internet gods

IF HE’S STILL IN, IM STILL IN 🚀🚀🚀🌛
Can anyone explain this chart for me
What else should we buy and hold now
I spent 50 dollars at gamestop for a headset 2 weeks ago
I could've bought into GME with that and would've been holding 7 headsets right now

I have been in the equity business for 36 years now and I still learn everyday, so I appreciate what is happening in the US now with the new gaming investors
I understand the short-squeezing investment point, but to keep it and still buy a mediocre company which eventually return to the 10/20 level within 6 months or a year and will make a lot of bagholders I don't understand
I gotta get my dad to invest at this point

Have very few AMC though
Yeah
The idea is that you are suposed to buy only the amount you can afford to lose to make the hedgefund go bankrupt, you arent doing that for the money you may MAYBE get from this entire thing
I’m guessing 900 by the end of the week

Literally me
I sold out of some long term stocks just to buy a few more
Me holding my $1
My mom asked me if it was illegal earlier because the news said it was
My mom texted me and asked if I had ever heard of gamestop
My wife and I bought one share today, it’s really all we can afford to lose right now
We are the movement of "we like this stock"
I can relate
What do you do for work
I have to get this out because it's been on my mind
Something like this has never ever happened in the 204 years the stock market has been active
I'm currently working on a software     to decentralized WSB and sync its posts/comments in a decentralized     database
I'm the mod of the sub that talk about the project
I am the one who stonks

My husband said to me he hopes everyone who lost money doesn’t cry because you can’t beat Wall Street - I proceeded to tell him I am one of those people who are in the movement and he just shook his said and you will never win
I might have been a little late to the game but I got 1 GME and 20 AMC 💎🙌🏼
Rude
I love how this has turned from a legitimate money making opportunity, to now a movement against those in higher power that use and abuse the financial system and its rules
I now hold 2 shares in GME
When this blows up next week, we all need to be very careful about this
I imagine the beautiful mods are already on top of this, but be careful about those posts
This is not financial advice, sell whenever you want
I am going to keep holding because I really like this stock
I sold my one share before the dip and used the profit to buy two at 265 instead
I jumped in with 1 share today boys
I'm not in on GME, but my 60+ shares of NOK and 30 Shares of AMC are being held HARD
My son is the movement
I am the one who NOKs
Stick it to the man
I only have 3 AMC shares and feel very attacked rn xD
Listen here retards
I scrounged up enough to be able to buy 1 whole share
Serious question: Will I help the cause if I only buy 1 stock of GME
Hay that’s me holding one $NOK share I would hold more but I’m broke :(
DIAMOND HANDS TILL THE END

THERE IS NO SELL
THIS IS THE WAY
Can we all agree on deleting the Robinhood app
I’m half way on the other side of the globe and all I could think about last night is I wish could buy one share to be a part of this
The biggest storm starts with the one drop of rain
Lmao my mom texted me from work today asking about how wallstreetbets is doing, I am laughing at the absurdness of this all, feels like a fever dream
EVERY SHARE COUNTS
I wonder how many of these companies that are being heavily shorted by hedge funds were allowed to receive PPP loans from taxpayers, only to have to government let the billionaire hedge funds keep shorting them to the ground
Can I just say I love all of you guys and gals
It's difficult and pointless to scare poor people with the possibility of becoming poor
That’s my trick, cap
We need AMC and GME to partner
At this point I'm not selling my 40 shares until $2008
We need to prove that we are in control
Im obvously a noob here
God this is cringe, lurk more
This is what WSB is now
U/KEENFEED IS DOING HIS PART 🚀💎💎💎✊💎📈📈📈

I am the one who NOKs
I am the one who NOKs
NOK NOK (((who’s there
Man,  these past couple weeks have been amazing
This week that has all changed
After  belly laughing through posts and comments on Tuesday, I said screw it
In the meantime I watch  my major holdings AAPL beat earnings and get absolutely smoked
Friday  afternoon I watched the market tank after my favorite native american  politician said the market should be based on fundamentals
I've  enjoyed this immensely and can't wait for the suits to crap their bed  pans come next week
A single flame can burn down an entire forest
I don’t even have enough money to buy it
Im sorry, but im new to this and lost, is it worth it to buy one share now
Felt this lol 💀
Hahaha this is awesome
This is me right now
Haha that's how I feel with one share GME and some shares of BB
I got two shares holding 💎✋💎✋
My 3 shares are HODLING THE LINE
We are all in it
Lmfao had this exact conversation with my mother Tuesday
Is it to late to get a share when the market opens back up
Gotta say, I've been holding since 13/share (sold and bought again cause i suck and now avaraged at 32
It was then that i realized that the paid jornal is getting the information from where i literally am all day everyday
WE ARE THE MOVEMENT RETARDS
I broke down and bought a midrange Nokia 7
How do I make it jump
Buy open, nio, bb, amc, gme, tsla, hold
This is me with my 0
I hold 11 shares
Hi, I'm new, is it too late to invest in gamespot or not
Keep hitting boys
Bought two shares today, THIS IS THE WAY 🚀🚀🚀
Everyone I know is telling me to sell my one share
Everyone counts, no matter how many shares they own
This is the way
Interesting
I’m having the same issue
Do you bank with them as well
I THINK PayPal will instant for a small fee (10 bucks per)
Use your routing and account number
What’s a good app or program to use to get started
I flipped out on RH for freezing me out of BB, AMC, and GME
Ahahahahha
Thanks, just wanted to confirm if stocks were bought individually, or if it was related to the amount spent, thanks
I feel the same way about wallstreet as I do about Jane
Oof
Wow, what an ape
Yes AMC is the move
That’s the beauty
Its all I could afford
Every share you hold is x10 or more valuable right now
I love how we don't take ourselves seriously
I could only afford two shares
I own 7 shares of AMC because that’s all I can afford
The cost of justice = 1 share of GME
So I have 17 precious shares
Any updates on the RH/Citadel 
Edit: court cases, complaints, etc
HOLDTHELINE
My precious 5 shares of AMC
I am once again asking for your diamondancial support
I'm unemployed with no savings but Waiting to be approved to get a single share too
I am the one who NOKS
I started doing Robinhood last spring, looked  at Gamestop's stock sitting at $2/3 and laughed
AMC tho
I'm holding on to my 4 shares of AMC
Amc for the win
You all see this is going global the Asian market is picking it up gme stock
I like GEO
I can only afford 4 shares but it's worth being a part of this movement
I'm poor so I too hold one share
Wish I could afford a GME share but it looks like I’m holding AMC instead :,)
Well my parents think im the wolf of wall street but in reality im just a retard who bet all of his savings in a game store that doesnt have a single store in his country
Joined the 1 GME share club today, for the funsies
This was real with my Dad today
PERIOODDDD
I resemble this remark
Honest question; would it be worth me (a total newbie to the stock market) buying even a single share of GME at this point
Regardless of the outcome of GME, I plan on snagging some BB and AMC stocks
Holding 3 in the U
K
I've always done this alone, now we can finally together
I AM THE ONE WHO HOLDS
Holding 4 GME shares and 20 AMC
My fellow retards, you guys need to stop wasting money on useless Reddit awards and buy GME shares

My teenager : omg mom

Bought a share of AMC and NOK
HOLD THE DOOR
No movements we just like the stock
This is 100% me
I’m the awkward one that bought one share of GME mid 2020 and forgot about it
It was a “I guess I’m part of this now” kind of thing
We are the wall in wall street
I AM THE ONE WHO NOKS🚀
I just like the stonk
SMOL HANDS ARE STILL HANDS
I've bought one share yesterday
I AM THE ONE WHO STOCKS
My pop said "get out while your're still in the green"
I am 2 movements in this case
Would be in limbo for a week or two from what I understand
I’ve been on WSB for a year
See, I find that a very vague answer
No one knows
Is the Silver hype real
Is the Silver crowd part of the Degenerates or just Silverbugs
I love Silver and I truly believe it's extremely undervalued and it will go much higher
A guy invests 10k and sells when he is down 40% and you think that of me 
That’s actually me with my 2 shares 🚀🚀
My sons are 15 and 19 yrs 
My platoon leader and some other ncos heard about my commitment and profiting from gme and bb stocks
I’m doing my part
Is buying into AMC worth it at 13 dollars
This is the unity they have been asking for
This is the way
Use your shares to vote
Every share adds up tho 
I love you all so much man for real
I only have 18
One million apes holding one banana is the same as one ape holding one million bananas
Stay strong
Not advice, I’m struggling to type and breath at the same time
Yeaaa
Just dipped it guys
Everyone is talking AMC, AMC, AMC
Not much but I'm holding 3 shares 😂😂
New here, where do you buy the shares at
AMC flying till 1000%
The more they fight us the more they lose
I’m happy to be apart of this movement
One share, one thousand - you are the movement
Could only afford one stock AMC, BBBY & NOK keeping these until my grandbaby's (due on April) 18th bday
Purchased 5 shares of AMC and holding on for dear life
Listen up fellow autists
AAL is all I’m going to say

The borrow fee on GameStop’s stock — or the cost-to-borrow shares for the purpose of selling them short — jumped to 29
GameStop remained the most-shorted name in the market as short interest as a percentage of shares available for trading stands at 113
The original short sellers have been replaced in part by new vultures
It is now a matter of we all hang together for at least a week or two, or we will surely hang alone

Robinhood still hasn’t approved my transfer from the last two days so I couldn’t have more buying power
Edit: they’ve withdrawn it from my bank but I still do not have access to it as I’m already using my $1000 instant deposit limit
Emailed my senator
They were going to IPO this year and become billionaires
This is illegal as F
The amount of money hedge funds are bound to lose must be huge if they were able to convince RH to burn their company to ground with this move
So I’m an attorney, former stock broker and fellow autist
AND IT IS THE STRONGEST BUY SIGNAL EVER
We are close to breaking through the shorts

You can add AAL to the list of stocks that Robinhood is now blocking you from purchasing
Trading212 did the same thing, dont forget about your eurobros
Who's starting this
AND DONT FORGET ITS NOT JUST ROBINHOOD, it’s all the major trading platforms in the U
K
Their excuse is that basically it’s their intermediaries who are calling the shots - WELL THEY SHOULD STAND BY THEIR CUSTOMERS FFS
I currently cant find AMC or GME
Long time lurker, first time poster
They cancelled my orders for GME,BB, and NOK
Robinhood
I am 100% on board with this
RH is literally manipulating the market along with other brokerages trying to prevent people from buying shares from stocks which forces a price drop because you can only sell
Robinhood has a business deal with citadel to sell your fill information and stop loss levels to Citadel
This is an astonishing huge level of corruption
Silver lining: they said we didn’t matter
As a Canadian, loading up and ready to welcome you back anytime
Get this post to the front page
I'm in, they cancelled my order I placed last night, and in the message it states that I cancelled it, which is a total lie
There was no government or NYSE-mandated halt or suspension in place at this time
In addition to this being a gross violation of free market principles, this is also a violation of my rights as a call option holder, as I can no longer exercise my options
I believe this was done to manipulate the market at the behest of the firms Robinhood uses to actually execute trades, but that is just my theory
What I do know is that they sold me options contracts with "the right" to exercise them, but are now preventing me from doing so
I am pissed
Take screenshots for submission
I'm in
I was planning to just hold my remaining shares and see what happens
Close your Robinhood accounts once the squeeze is over
I will fight right beside all of you retards on this, sign me up
Can WallstreetBets start its own Brokerage
Everyone needs to use their social media to get CNBC’s Carl Quintanilla to report on this live on air
Ken Griffin loaned Melvin Capital billions of dollars
I put a limit order in for $AMC at 11:34PM CST last night on Robinhood, and that Limit Order went through at 8:00AM CST today at $14

I am not selling
This is wrong on so many levels
It’s pretty funny to me that rich folks are all about the free market until the free market turns on them
Google Robinhood LEAD INVESTOR, D1 Capital who was absolutely burned on GME
This was going to be my down payment on a house for my family
Now people can get real brokers
Seriously
What is TOS
Think or Swim
I thought TD Ameritrade halted GME buys too
I have a vanguard acct I wasn’t using for this because RH was convenient
For yesterday, RH seems to be in violation of FINRA Rule 5310, which states that RH “must make every effort to execute a marketable customer order that it receives promptly and fully
Today, investors are being damaged by not being able to access the markets and buy more shares (which may be market manipulation under 7 USC §9(3) or 15 USC §78i(a)(2) since they are artificially affecting demand for multiple securities)
Going to be pretty exciting trading in my $1,000,000 of GME for store credit of 97 cents
If the mods put an official post with an official link to a gofundme we can all pitch in for hire a legal team
Robinhood really should be punished for this
Anyone have suggestion on where to move my money to
I'm here for this
Robinhood has also blocked buying shares of AAL because it was mentioned here
Im trying to file an SEC report on Robinhood and the sight keeps crashing
Unreal that they’re locking out retail investors while the funds can still trade freely
ROBINHOOD WILL CEASE TO EXIST
I called MI Senator Gary Peters' office
This is the review I just left on the app store
AMC at 50% right now, when overnight all I saw was people wanting to buy it this morning
Word of mouth on social media is not “market manipulation”, it’s enthusiasm and 100% legal
Email your congressional representation as well guys
The People Have spoken and they cannot stop us
Sorry if this is a dumb question boys but I have to ask
This is actually disgusting
They canceled my order of $BB and then said that I canceled it
I hope todays events made you all realize its always been about the ultra rich vs the poor
Absolutely sick to my stomach on what they did
Robin Hood is done
If this mornings events didn’t inspire you to hold until the day you die than nothing will
Everyone needs to get on another platform and buy more GME, lawsuits take forever, we gotta win the day
Reddit won’t let me upvote anything here
DM me as well, I've got legal through work for personal use
Woke up and saw my account down 80% because all of my positions were “sell only”
Call your secretary of your state
The sickest part is, Robinhood is acting like it’s in OUR best interest to restrict trading
Ameritrade can catch this lawsuit too
My hands were formed in the mean corn rows of Nebraska, and they were hardened in the cold vacuum of space
Which it isn’t
I was planning on buying 10,000 shares at $125 today but RobinHood wouldn't let me

They call themselves RobinHood, but turned out to be HoodRobin
Question: is what RH did constitute insider trading
Hope they dont mind that 1 * rating  they have now
So if we can't buy, who is buying when we sell GME or AMC
Just submitted my ACAT to Etrade to transfer my account from Robinhood
I have screenshots of robinhood cancelling my order but it states, “you have cancelled your order”
At this point even if it was only robinhood, all shareholders get affected negatively even if you use robinhood or not
Liquidate your robinhood accounts immediately
They kicked in twice in one day on the way up
Im a retard from the North of Sweden that invested yesterday just for the sake of it, just because i admire the David vs Goliath perspective on this whole spectacular rollercoaster of a ride - movement
S
Here you go
Putting my money where my mouth is
Robinhood is clearly guilty of the second one right out the gate
The new story of David and Goliath, but Goliath gets to ban slingshots as David starts to place his stone in the slingshot
Ken Griffin, owner of Citadel, happens to be a large investor of Robinhood
Robinhood is basically only allowing you to sell out of your positions, causing a drop in the stock price
In essence, you see institutional investors unhindered because of pre-market and after-market trading
Ken Griffin is likely the person requesting Robinhood to limit $GME trades
Remember this
Just like pepperidge farm remembers
To be honest - if you’ve ever seen Dragon Ball then you know that this is the moment where we the people legitimately send our energy into the heavens to create the Diamond Hands Spirit bomb & destroy the evil doer who is trying to crush us
As soon as RH did this they went bankrupt
Trading 212 doing it to euro poors as well
If anyone is able to help lmk
I'm on
In for sure
I’ve been in the equities game for a couple of decades
Yeah
You can still buy on ToS, one of the platforms of TDA
I mean webull hasnt
Ameritrade has no problems
Not to get political, can't believe I actually agree with her
Bro I wanted to put in $20k
I had $4000 ready to buy shares today and robinhood blocked me
I cannot tell you how much I needed to read this right now
Happy to help
Yup
Did you just unironically reee
Livelihood is the word
It’s absolutely insane that this is happening
EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT ON RH, you need to be a part of this
I am transferring my Robinhood account and closing it
Please be careful, they have changed the rules to the game
There are 3 major parts that I think is going to make Monday very, very red
First obviously limited buying from restrictions
Second, cannot buy calls
Third and possibly most importantly calls that are held without capital to exercise them are going to be the undoing of this short squeeze
I really hope this isn't correct
Everyone should contact their congressmen, if enough of us do that we get serious support

If the average investor loses money because of this, this also lowers tax amount to the state for writing off
Wall Street is not messing around anymore boys, they willl all team up and shut down our short squeeze with more money than you can imagine, this is prison rules now, they cant let one man die or else they all look weak
I can’t believe this
This is singlehandedly the craziest thing I’ve ever seen
Not a Robinhood investor, but filing complaints with the SEC, FINRA, and Robinhood
It's not WSB selling
These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price
Every share they sell is borrowed
Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen
This is a repost
The exchanges and hedge funds are now openly working together to drive the price down (manipulation)
I deposited $200 into robinhood last night and woke up this morning to my stock orders cancelled
If this is some conspiracy, we’re going to end up paying for this twice: here and again when our tax money gets used to put them up in prison
Mods should sticky the lawsuit when it happens
WANTED TO BUY 
WTF Robinhood
I don't trade with robinhood but this affects not only their customer base but every trading platforms base
Robinhood turns out to be Sheriff of Nottingham
Just submitted my transfer to Ameritrade
Only allowing to sell when there is a 140% short interest is def market manipulation

Take any cash you have in RH and transfer it back to your bank
Robinhood cancelled my order this morning for Nok and AMC that I put in last night
Can't stress this enough, chase media outlets - local and national
Doing my part , moving my 1
LETS GET EM BOYS WOOHOO
The legal fallout from this is gonna be a sight to see
By preventing anyone from buying gme, robinhood probably scared many people into selling
So stupid
I'm selling all of the stocks I've had in Robin Hood
All the brokerages that use Apex Clearing firm to clear their trades are being strong armed to restrict to sells
If Robinhood lifts this restriction because of backlash, we’ll easily see 1000
It's not just Robinhood, it's all of the US brokers (from what I've read)
Let’s short RobinHood out of existence on their IPO
This isn't even Robinhood's fault
How hard is it to transfer all positions and cash from Robinhood to another platform
Yesterday, you could still go to the web version and buy but it seems they've locked that down too
I'm buying AMC in my Fidelity HSA and IRA
To not allow buying of options or shares and only allow selling literally creates a situation where hedge funds have 100% control over the manipulation of the stock
I liquated all RH account, Thankfully I have been using a different platform and have all my important tendie trains there
Do not leave Robinhood yet, let them IPO later this year and ditch right before first earnings
Get involved in the lawsuit if possible, but DO NOT LEAVE ROBINHOOD, that's what they want
Melvin is a $GME short seller predicted to lose BILLIONS due to the people taking the free market back
Citadel processes 60% of the order volume from the app Robinhood
Citadel banned purchases of new $GME shares on RH
Market manipulation
The (relatively) tiny SEC fines will be much less than the billions lost if it continues, so they are doing blatant market manipulation
I dunno about you all
Robinhood deserves this
BUY DOGGGGGEEEEE
RobinHood should call themselves hoodrobbin cause they stealing from the poor
Just announced; Robinhood changing their name to SheriffofNottingham
In a few days we plummeted rating of Robinhood from 4

Otherwise open an account at another brokerage, and do the same thing
Lastly, you can request all shares be transferred to another the brokerage

Excellent point

It hasn't for me
They all shorted at 350 and you'll never squeeze them back up without retail
Shorted at 350
When they know the retail platforms are about to tank the market it's easy money
When do we have to hit 350
It's never hitting 350 again
Dude they havent setted their positions yet
What do you think Robin Hood is gonna do when it goes in that direction
What they've already done
As soon as my investment in Canoo comes to fruition I am out and probably headed to Fidelity
It appears that is the one to go to
Curious about this as well
If you have something to say to the brokers etc, you should say it to them, not on a social media forum #okboomer
I thought they had closed their positions 2 days ago

I entered my order to sell AMC last night (with the intention of buying more GME this morning)
Wake up 40% gone
We need to focus on Holding right now
Just filed my complaint with the SEC
Did you think they were good guys
RH just released a press statement that comes down to "You're doing it wrong, so we have to stop you"
Okay regards, anyone who's broker isn't letting them trade needs to move to the ones that do and buy the f'n dip
We love a stock and they block us
If this doesn’t make you exit RH then I don’t know what will
Vanguard is the real Robinhood
I lost about 3k thanks to Robinhood's market manipulation this morning and I am willing to spend another 3k to make sure that App doesn't exist

Call your state attorney generals, secretary of your state, US senators, and reps

Its gonna take 2 days to get approved or more
After this I’m making the move permanently
Same lol, this is insane, what good reason could they have to do this
If you’re involved in AMC or any of the stocks affected, you should be eligible because the stock price plummeted based on their actions
I worked for GameStop for 8 years and left only recently to pursue a career in my field after graduating from college
JFC I can't imagine the losses people are going to see today putting in their entire savings on a totally legal and totally sure thing only to have it illegally taken from them
Just hold
Take your business elsewhere
Jump ship, and never forget what this bank did
It's ironic that an app called "Robinhood" is actually trying to protect the rich and fcking up the poor
So
SO let me get this straight
Robinhood was supposed to be about taking from the rich and giving to the poor
I think GME, AMC, etc would all have a strong case against them as well
I DON'T CARE IF IT TAKES HALF A YEAR TO GET ROLLING, I WILL SIGN MY NAME AND DESTROY ROBINHOOD
Down 7k because of this restriction
Options locked
Hmmm this seems legal -
Got info on starting the lawsuit
YOU CAN BUY ON WEBULL ITS OWNED MY ALIBABA
I saved my screenshot where it said I could only sell, not buy
They just sold my shares
When you short is going so bad that you have to call Robinhood to disallow people from buying the stock
Robinhood is trash
I'm moving all my position out of the RH to other firm
We should sue for 400-500 billion
I think we should sue them all for colluding
I was able to buy on Webull earlier
It's clear that Melvin and Citadel would rather Robinhood pay minimal legal fees over a long period than to burn through billions of $ in a short period
I hope they add all stocks that were affected
Sorry my fellows
Get instant gratification by giving the app a true review: [https://apps
It just dawned on me the irony of them being called robinhood when they try their hardest to steal from the poor to give to the rich
Will we be able to participate if we don’t trade on RH
Interactive brokers too
Robinhood don't have our backs
I've lost $200+ from shorts and other market manipulation techniques that drive decent stocks to $0 and now that we're calling their bluff they change the rules
Screw that, I'm in
I’m down 30% today because of robinhood
I’m all in on this lawsuit
Where do we sign the petition on a lawsuit
All of the brokers "independently" locked all of retail on a sinking ship with no way to save themselves
Thousands and thousands of pissed off users
I’m in

WE CAN SEND LETTERS TO CONGRESS
Leaving a comment here as a paper trail for later
This affects anyone with a positon on GME not just robinhood users
Robinhood can kiss goodbye to their ipo debut

I tried to set up an account last night to buy GME
Just bought at $150 with schwab edit: 5 mins later order hasn't filled yet
I am 100% switching to webull
I'm on their website right now and I can't find any ticker symbols and get a 404 error
Probably has too much load on their servers from everyone trying to switch
They can only control us because we use their currency
Charles Schwab too
Couldn't even look up the stock prices of amc or gamestop on robinhood this morning
Yo BB and AMC doesn't even show up when I search the tickers

I am shutting down my Robinhood account today
Don't forget to go to the app store and upset your review of robinhood

Time to change brokers
Hey so if I transfer from Robinhood to Vanguard, will my cash in Robinhood transfer too
Dumb ape question I know
How do I get my shares out of Robinhood before the squeeze
Lets do it, I don't want any money
So I was late to the game but fully planned to join in today, even withdrew money before markets opened to only be screwed by Robinhood, I have no other accounts with other brokerages
Showing my support
Ok so after GME, i’ll likely pull out of Robinhood
Not only do I not have Robinhood, I've been warning you Melvins about them forever
Is there a good replacement for Robin Hood to jump too
What about the European trading apps not allowing buying of stocks
Lawsuit filed in Southern District of New York by Brendon Nelson

I blinked
Holy hell this got 141k upvotes in 3 hours

I created a Robinhood account last night specifically to buy GME
If RH goes public can we short them into dust using RH
If you can only sell and not buy, then who is buying what you sell
I'm opening a robinhood account so I can sue later
I am trading on a german brokerage and couldnt buy either
Opened a fidelity account and am transferring my shares from Robinhood
HOW DO I JOIN IN THIS
And to think I was interested in their IPO
Sincerely,
Which platform should we move to
Absolutely ridiculous
I opened an account with Fidelity and am in the process of transferring my Robinhood account
If they ever go public
Interactive brokers not allowing shares to be purchased either
Pulling out everything but GME from "Robbing Hood"
The settlement will be cheaper than what they made off this little scam of theirs
Ja Rule, where are you retard
Ffs can people learn the difference between loose and lose, it’s not that hard
If you Americans can, get yourself on European apps, AFAIK they have laws to stop this
They canceled my BB and AMC orders that i put in yesterday
It sounds to me like there's a sort of mini-nuclear war happening on Wall Street over this
Don't ever forget that RobinHood was caught selling user data to Citadel
Citadel is an investor in Melvin Capital, which got run over by Wall Street Bets
How do I sign up for the lawsuit
Start a Twitter campaign against RH too
RH would've gained so much from this if they just stood up for the right thing instead of corrupting their morals
Own 51 in BB and can’t do anything
Just pulled all of my investments off of Robinhood and reinvested via a different platform
What investing platform do you guys suggest
So pissed
Edit: hold for me boys, I have to look from a distance now
We should also go after citadel
My money is all stuck in Robin Hood
Hold Strong And Buy More $AMC $GME  **🚀🚀🚀**
My money is all stuck in Robin Hood

Oh my gourd
Your money and shares were transferred and tradable in 30 mins
Account opened and had money to trade with from a linked Bank account in 30 minutes  The transfer of shares apparently takes a while longer
Ok that’s what I thought just checking, thanks
Everything I’ve seen says 5 day hold
What market manipulation
Their “idea” of market manipulation
Amc can be bought on cash app
Amc can be bought on cash app
Amc can be bought on cash app
I morally had to cash everything out and I'll be withdrawing my money from them
Hope Wall st is paying RH enough to burn the company to the ground, because this is what will happen to RH now
They took down whole fking reddit wth this is insane
Add Ally to that list
I contacted an actual lawyer
Short their IPO🚀🚀😂😂
Congratulations, you figured out how the game works
Lets get this lawsuit filed
What’s to stop them from preventing us from selling during the squeeze
It’ll be hilarious if this ends up not even working to suppress $GME and Robinhood just nuked themselves for nothing
Wanted to sell my 6500 in TSLA to get some GME but RH app says GME isn't sister
Remember folks, this is happening not because they are worried about people losing money on volatile stocks, they are doing it because the wrong people are making money and the “right people” are losing money
Will split legal fees for this
Sure, we signed an agreement to not sue them, BUT THEY AGREED TO LET US TRADE
My contribution is small, but my gratitude is big
Td ameritrade restricted yesterday, lawsuit as well
I believe that the halting of trading on these positions of a select few companies effectively manipulates the market and in turn helps these institutional trading companies, mainly Citadel LLC and Melvin Capital, to recover their losses at the expense of XXX investors
I ask that your office investigate the alleged connection between Citadel LLC and Melvin Capital with Robinhood Financial LLC and their alleged collusion and subsequent market manipulation
How can i change my existing stocks to another company without selling
Can I leave robinhood and migrate my entire portfolio to another brokerage
I would suggest that we short them if only they were a publicly traded company
For those in the UK you can list a dispute with the [Financial ombudsman](https://www
A bunch of other apps and buying platforms halted it too
I'm closing my account as soon as this is all said and done
Robinhood
I will leave RobinHood as soon as this mess is over
The other brokerages need to be included as well
Is there a better app to do what robinhood can
So now these stocks are on sale
What’s going on
App Store showing a 4
Its not just robinhood its every app and webservice regular people can use
I didn't buy into this, but what Robindhood did was criminal
What app should I use instead
Already cashed out
So they've just killed their business, yeah
Etoro has #gme back online
For the smooth-brains that invested on Robinhood: don't leave just yet
Screen shot the patterns  of AMC NOK GME this is evidence circumstantial until you see different hedges  selling there price lower than market to help bring the price down that is coordinated manipulation
Robin Hood is the character in history who stole from the poor and protected the rich
Can't WAIT to short Robinhood's IPO when they go public
If Robinhood and your exsisitng brokers aren't letting you buy stocks you want, why aren't you moving to another broker
I dont use robinhood, but my account took a hit bc of their actions
Is anyone going to recommend brokerage apps that didn’t manipulate the stonks today
How do I fully delete my account
With all these restrictions on RH, I’m getting a sense that they are in deep financial trouble
What if everyone bought 1 share of GME Monday to protest Robinhood's corruption
They did the same to me
This will get buried but we need to hire MARK LANIER
If everyone is leaving Robinhood what app is the go to app
Is there a broker that did not try to screw us over
Today RobinHood said it would allow me to buy shares of Gme and Amc as well as several others that were blocked from trading yesterday, but when I went to buy them it claimed I already owned too many shares to execute an order
So after purchasing (less than 2 shares have you) of GME and then them deeming me unsuitable for purchase I wanted to delete the app but can’t because my money is still there and they won’t let me transfer it back
The owners of internet platforms where much of the discussion took place are likewise shielded from liability for users' activity under a 25-year-old law known as Section 230
Robinhood's users were at the center of this week's wild rally in a handful of stocks that had been heavily shorted by hedge funds and championed by individual investors in online chatrooms including Reddit's WallStreetBets
The lawsuits, brought in federal court, allege that the Menlo Park, California-based company breached its contractual obligation as a regulated broker to execute orders promptly and effectively
However, Robinhood is not legally bound to carry out every trade and the lawsuits will not succeed without evidence the company restricted trading for an improper reason, such as to favor certain investors, according to several legal experts
The user agreement on Robinhood's website says it "may at any time, in its sole discretion and without prior notice to Me, prohibit or restrict My ability to trade securities
I have every single screenshot and yes I lost money
I sold my stock because of the downturn thinking I could repurchase later in the day, I take screenshots of everything
When I wanted to buy back my position unknown to me I found it was now basically made illegal to purchase stocks
Can I lose my money i put into robinhood as a result of this lawsuit
Makes me sick that I keep seeing the ads about how “it was built for you” what a load of shot
They need 2 be changing that name quick
Christian Iovin represented by Hagens Berman  - DO NOT JOIN THAT ONE
Here we go again no way to buy just fuken sell bottom is active what a hell Robin 
They use very fast tricks for make you lose money, things that you can’t prove it
Two words: Arbitration Agreement
Ask yourself, are you in this to make money, or are you in this because GME is a stock you want to own forever
Eventually enough people will realize they are in it for the money, and when wsb goes to cash out, this is gonna be such a bloodbath
Please don't be mad guys
I was up $600 on a $2 SNDL call I made months ago
We all agreed to the terms and services though
Any action against them will largely be contract-based, i
Takes a month, Robinhood is scum
This
Etrade definitely works, others are being listed keep checking around
Yes cept I’m even Steven now
How enforceable is it in California
It’s enforceable in any state they are registered in
I am a lawyer
Cool story bruh
If the client doesn’t meet specific net worth, income, and trading experience then industry regs require the firm deny the client access to strategies that could expose the client to an oversized amount of risk that the client is unable to absorb (financially)
Why not just use another app
I use Robin Hood and it blocked my amc buy I’d be down to join
Should rebrand Robinhood as sheriff of all douches
Tastyworks now manipulating AMC GME and KOSS as well
If only there were an emerging technology meant to offer a means of a decentralized, immutable marketplace where stonks could be tonkenized and sold digitally
Uh, aren't all the places restricting GME and AMC and BB and others right now
Never did I expect cancel culture to flood it's way into the financial markets too
I didn’t get a chance to buy into gme but I have other stocks through Robinhood, should I cut the ribbon and sell off my stocks
I have sold all the stocks I had in Robinhood and will be transferring the proceeds to another firm
Can’t buy aal,Nok, and bb also 
I'm going to see if I can speak to a lawyer about this
You signed up for their terms of service, which gives them permission to allow or deny you to trade
Where can I buy GME i was queued in for $150 order last night and woke up to find out that Robinhood isn’t allowing buy orders
Yup
Robinhood has it in their terms and conditions that they can restrict your ability to purchase a stock without prior notice
Get a better broker, idiots
Here's the link to the customer agreement you agreed to when opening your account
Page 11, Section 16: Restrictions on Trading
Isn't getting a lot of people to buy GME and artificially inflate the price the same thing, lmao
No one is forcing anyone to buy GME though
They're only responding to the blatant artificial inflation
Trying to switch to Webull
Just sold all my holdings in robinhood and moving my money as soon as its available to withdraw
Hit back at Robinhood
They're a private company, this is perfectly legal lol
This is also manipulating the market, by not allowing people to buy, only sell, they are guiding the price of the stock down
I think you forget WSB got to this point by market manipulation
Yeah well, have you read the terms of service of ANY brokerage you signed up with
You forget that their overnight halting of sales negatively effects the millions of investors outside of the app
Yeah, that won’t hold up to a real fight
They still have to follow the law
Illegal actions void the contract, and this is racketeering
You can still sue them even with those agreements
LMAO you've artificially inflated a stock from silly market rules (forced short sale purchases
They shouldn't be legally required to buy and sell your stock for you
Also you're abusing insider information because you know about the short sales
The entire system is fraudulent
Upvote and award for visibility
We need to tweet, FB, Instagram, etc
God-given access
My $10 fraction share was cancelled brothers 😔 keep fighting the good fight
How can I prove I was affected by this if I had not placed an order to buy
Please post advice on how all of us can begin gathering evidence
AMC and BBBY still on cash app
Anyone else feel like the winds just fell out of our sails
Next we figure out how to go after Citadel
Cashapp needs to be included in this lawsuit
I just emptied my Robinhood account and WeBull
I highly recommend reading their post about stopping GME and AMC sells
Has anyone checked TOS
ROBINSELL
The funny thing is the broker apps' reasoning for restricting buying is to 'protect us from the risks involved' but hey, I didn't take out any risky short positions, I'm not using margin, maybe we should educate the hedge funds about their risky bets, hmmm
Can someone please explain to me the concept of using a service for free and then get really mad at the company when they side with their paying customers
Lin Wood might just be the right kind of crazy for this
Don’t believe his lies please, he’s a shyster
Sure what Robin Hood is doing is market manipulation but isn't rallying 4
We are completely individual users with no connection other than being subscribed to the subreddit

After the market closes today, the updated short interest data will be released
What you are witnessing is perhaps the greatest redistribution of wealth in modern history
This is not financial advice and you should do what you want, but I’m buying every dip

They already have lost me thousands this morning by not allowing me to buy

They most likely had a roundtable discussion with the short sellers and evaluated potential losses from a decision like this and made a deal
WE MAKE THEM LOSE ON BOTH SIDES
MACY'S IS STILL OPEN BOYS AND GIRLS LETS GOOOOOO
You have my sword
I was out because I didn't care too much
Just pulled all my money out of Robinhood
I’m in this is total BS
I want to move all my trades to fidelity but that means taking the tax hit when I cash out

It's not just Robin hood, I can't even open my portfolio on stash
IF EVERYBODY LEAVES ROBINHOOD NOW THEY WILL END UP WITHOUT CLIENTS
I Am really really getting pissed off
How is it POSSIBLE that they block you from buying GME
They are relatives from Melvin
AND WHO TELLS ME MY BROKER WILL NEVER DO THE SAME IN FUTURE WITH ANOTHER STOCK TO ME
This is misuse of power This is not democracy
Wtf
BUY IN E*TRADE
Guys, it’s obvious
I put in an order for GME last night and I wake up to a message that says I canceled my order
Robinhood has the worst customer service you can’t even get anyone on the phone
I will support

While I agree with the goal, I think this should first be a criminal law suit, before being a business one
I'm Canadian and don't use RH
Agreed
I think the SEC site crashed
It’s not enough just to sue Robinhood
They’ve also made it impossible to even search for these stocks, as if they don’t exist
Lets give it to them
Same for all other stocks they banned
Trading212 is doing the same right now too :/
I have BB options
If you’re a LAWYER START SOMETHING

I sold $100 of AMC by accident
How are there no new Robin Hood reviews on the app store
While you can certainly try, I caution against this idea because it will likely fail
Judge Goldstein already ruled in favor of RH
Well if they are not allowing the free market trades they should be held accountable
And FD Ameritrade
Thing is, we can actually pay for it now lols
I'm in, this is clearly a move to cover for Citadel and it is illegal
They can not get away with this
Robinhood is forced to bow to the pressure
Robinhood was savvy, and gave retail traders an outlet for trading where they had access to a variety of investment mechanisms at the touch of a smart phone screen
I don't blame Robinhood for wanting in on the action

Among the stocks affected by the restrictions are GameStop (GME) , AMC Entertainment (AMC) , BlackBerry (BB) and Nokia (NOK) 
Wallstreetbets has been promoting a number of stocks that short-sellers bet against, triggering a short squeeze, or a rapid surge in the price of a stock due primarily to technical factors in the market rather than underlying fundamentals
In a statement, Robinhood said it raised its margin requirements for certain securities and revamped and expanded its educational resources site in light of the recent volatility
Meanwhile, a TD Ameritrade spokesperson said the restrictions were put in place "out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors," according to media reports

I have been impacted by Robinhoods market manipulation
They cancelled my order so def in
ONLY DO IT IF YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL LIKE IT
I LIKE THIS SUIT
I am down
This is so unfair
They cancelled my AMC buy order
In for sure
I'm in, they wouldn't let me buy in on amc yesterday Morning and now I sold what I had in amc to buy GME and they havint put the money in my account I have screenshots it could be a server error so I'm waiting untill tomorrow to give them a chance
This happened right as one of the biggest shareholders sold all their stock, ensuring that only hedge funds would be able to buy
In
In -- Gonna look into how to get this started
In, stopping private investors to protect the already rich is an admission that the market is manipulated in favor of the rich everyday even at our expense
What if long holders exercised all their deep in the money calls
Needs to be a suit against NASDAQ, TDAmeritrade, Robinhood, etc
Are there any other brokerage apps we can use to buy GME
This is illegal and these manipulators need to be brought to justice
Crazy idea but, maybe could WSB make its own platform, like a savings & loan or something
Move your accounts from RH to some other platform
Include Revolut, they are doing it too
Sue em all
Don’t forget to file your SEC complaints
I'm in
It’s simple really
I'm in
Help
I hold positions in a lot of these stocks and then some I doubt are heavily traded and I CAN ONLY SELL ON THOSE

There's apparently a clause in the TOS that states that you've waived the right to sue them
Let's go sign me up
Had 3grand in amc that was canceled
For those in the UK: Trading 212 is doing the same
So in
Theoretically if you own a robinhood account you can be apart of this lawsuit
Edit: Schwab has also now banned trading of the stock, it seems the common denominator is that Citadel is the one that will lose the most on $GME and they are the ones that fund the zero dollar trading fees for these companies
Down 5% cause I couldn’t average down before selling smh
Selling and withdrawing all my shares on Robinhood EXCEPT for my GME
Can we get one for Trading212 too
Where do i sign up

What if closing your position actually involves buying…
Merrill Edge is also halting opening of new positions on GME and AMC
HOW IS A SERVICE GOING TO NOT LET ME SELL A SUPPORTED SECURITY
I screenshotted every stock I have on Robinhood to show which ones I can't buy, and only sell
IBKR is doing the same
In , they canceled my order without my consent then emailed me saying I requested to cancel
Let’s goooo
I’ll be more than happy to join this one
I'm in, was buying more on open
In the meantime my suggestion is all the users to downrate their apps on the stores to drive their ratings down to show illegitimate vendor - so they feel immediately that its the retail who is their customer, not big boys
Happening here in Europe too Binck Bank has blocked anyone from opening positions or buying GME or AMC
Is Robinhood the only platform doing this
In
I'm in this is glorious
I will cosign on this

I don’t trade on robinhood but I am in it to support you autists

Robinhood behaving like reverse Robinhood

My after hours GME order was cancelled and as we all know now, I'm no longer able to buy it through the app
Big hedge funds win
Little guy wins

I created a RobinHood account yesterday to switch over to because I liked their UI

On other hand, my Schwab account allowed me to buy NOK and BB just not much cash there
Im in DM me
It's not just Robinhood
F RH, I'm in
I’m in on that
Transfer your cash out of Robinhood and into E*TRADE

Trading 212 as well
Where do I sign
Any lawyers who want to take this
I just tried to search for BB, AMC, NOK, and BBBY on RH and it wouldn't show any of them
Yall named your app Robin Hood

Fight the corrupt criminals in suits
Sign me up
Not even an investor but I’m in
They have my money and I can't buy
Here are some screeenshots
Where's the GoFundMe
Looks like I’m all in on BB
Need to throw TD on the target list too
Also Robinhood blocked BB
What ever I need to do to make this happen let me know I am sorry to all the fellow people here i sold because I thought it was going to be locked and I wouldn't be able to access anything I am happy you diamond handed dingdongs held and it went back up believe me I feel like barfing
This is 100% market manipulation
HOW MUCH DID THEY BRIBE HIM FOR
If you are having issues with Robinhood please email them at help@robinhood
Stay strong and resolute
GME + BB = 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I lost money because robinhood shut me out
Cancelled my AMC and NOK orders that I did not cancel, somehow BB went through but now I can only sell and unable to purchase more
They cancelled my order for Nok
Do not sell your shares
Someone needs to actually start this instead of just talking about it
I’m in
Since I'm from Europe I can't join you guys unfortunately, but I'm happy that you're taking actions and Robin Hood probably will have to face consequenses for this snitch move
Anybody knows good lawyers
They cancelled my trades this morning, and erased this weeks gains
I’m in, I had money queued to buy this morning, they better compensate me and then some
I’m in
The same for Trading212
Sooo they can restrict specific stocks to "protect" their users from volatility
Where were they in March 2020
Webull is corrupted too
Sign me up
I was late to GME, but jumped in on 1 each for BB and NOK
Short sellers are dipping out faster than a priest on the run and there is nothing we can do about it
I'm in
Where do we sign up
Canceled my order said i successfully canceled myself
There needs to be some type of quantifiable value we can put to how much people "lost" over not being able to purchase it this morning or at the very least the canceled orders
I’m in
In the rules should be the same for everyone
Im in
Wow it is not just the current hot stocks (GME, BB, AMC etc
I see it went up a bit yesterday
I have messaged them that I am closing my account as soon as I close any positions I have
I know Fidelity is working on GME and AMC
And everyone thinks we’re the bad guys
Thy canceled my order
And they have the audacity to say I CANCELLED MY ORDER
In
I’m in
I was also impacted by their corruption today, unacceptable
In
I wish I could buy 20 more shares of GME right now
Trading 212 also did the same, what a shame
Does this include people who don't trade with Robinhood
Old Robinhood slogan: “democratizing the financial system”
Amc down to 8, this is BS
I took a screenshot showing they say now that GME is not supported (whatever that means)
I'm in where do I sign
Honestly after this mornings dip nothing scares me anymore
Count me in
I am selling the small amount of stock I have in Robinhood and moving all my stocks to fidelity where I have my 401k and other funds
Can we all stop watching CNBC too
Lose ffs it’s lose
I bought NOK shares last night and woke up to a canceled order
Let’s take em down
Would this mean more tendies
Tell me where to sign up
I opened an account with Fidelity
Also, a complaint to SEC
I opened a robinhood account and put $300 in it, to invest when markets opened this morning, and couldn't purchase anything, can't get my money out of robinhood to be able to use elsewhere
You need proof
Boys imagine once they let us buy again LMFAO GME TO THE MOOOOON
They cancelled my order and made it seem like I requested the cancelation
Everyone will definitely leave Robin Hood and go somewhere else now
Don't know if anyone has mentioned this but Trading 212 is doing the exact same thing
I agree, I didn't even know about the reddit war against these hedge funds until last night
Not to mention RH's long history of the app being unusable in high gain moments of opportunity that cost many people thousands
What other stock trading apps have game stop open to buy in
TIAA is letting me buy
My Robinhood account was worth $3k yesterday now $500
I was ready to drop $20,000 into GME this morning, but was prohibited from doing so, with my own money in Robinhood
Its not just robinhood
How do we get in
Be sure to leave them a bad review on the App Store too
Give them a review with your opinion on all platform
This is the way
In, and closing my account
I tried to withdraw the $ in my RH cash, back to my bank and it's denying that too
Then they had server outages and shut off both buying and SELLING of another equity I had
They said I cancelled my order for GME and NOK
I am in
I'm affected
BUY THE DIP
EDIT: Public has now also stopped buying of $GME (and $AMC)
Leave the platform
They can seriously kiss their ipo goodbye this time
Make sure to rate them on the App Store
Just saying "In" isn't enough
I'm in boises 4 more on ii
Trading212 is doing the same
I'll join
Hurt them where it counts
What’s a good alternative to Robinhood
Literally JUST got my RH account approved last night and bought $20 of GME, this morning I went to check on it to find they canceled my purchase and hid the stock, now its up 20% I WILL SUE FOR MY $4
I can't buy  in
My money and buying power have been COMPLETELY suppressed
I’m in I wanted to buy earlier but couldn’t
Can’t win, so I’m in
Bots are downvoting this hard
Unbelievable
They canceled my order without my consent
Luckily I still got some this morning with E*Trade 😁
Are there any decent alternatives to RH
Better add Ally to that lawsuit since they’re hiding your account AND blocking purchases for certain stocks
I'm in I lost money because of them
Robinhood is restricting AAL as well :-)
Someone file ill join
I took a pic, it also says the same for BB and AMC
This was just removed from r/all
They are hiding negative reviews
Same thing with stash they won't even let you log in
We will take these cocksuckers to cleaners

What's a good alternative way of trading
We will take these cocksuckers to cleaners
I'm selling off my normal RH stocks (read: NOT GME because I like this stock) and someday when this is all over I will uninstall their app
Just use fidelity
Whats a good brokerage
Robinhood and Webull are engaged in market interference of high volatility stocks
It looks like the regular (SEC) gave RH the okay to do this as per CNBC this morning
Let’s get a TD Ameritrade suit too
I tried buying some last night on RH, knowing nothing about the process of anything, and they cancelled my orders this morning when the market opened
Anybody heading this up
Once this is all over: [https://robinhood
They screwed me out of thousands by manipulating
Td is doing the same thing
Webull is under high server load but allowing trades, bought 3 @350
Sign me up
Please give us your shares
I can't even deactivate my RH account right now
This is a denial of opportunity and is not responsive to their fiduciary responsibility as a broker dealer
Where do we sign on
Down with the conglomerate
Lets all give Robinhood 1 star on Google play and apple store
NIO BREAK ATH MONDAY
I can’t even withdraw money from my RH account

Sign me up
Not just RH
Unfortunately, the SEC is probably pay in on it
In
Robinhood is not the only way to buy GME
They r doing it with any stock that is heavily shorted that goes up to fast, they did it with sundial growers
They will re-open these stocks to avoid law suits dont worry
SoFi still letting me buy
Today will be remembered as Bloody Thursday
I sold on RH and purchased on CashApp
Avanza in Sweden is letting me buy, but I have nothing to buy with anymore
What Robinhood is doing is 'fixing the market'
Trading 212 in the UK started doing this yesterday
Today you can not buy AMC or GME at all
Another difference from rh is you can't use margin (instant deposit) to buy options
In
Please ensure you do the same for trading212
I would sign on for this lawsuit
I think webull allows for buying as well
I would sign on for this lawsuit
TDAMERITRADE let me buy as well
Robinhood destroyed my hopes and dreams
I need to get off Robinhood
Lets do it
Give RobinHood a bad review in the App Store 
Do this to Apple and crash the market
I can’t even close out of my AMC positions on Robinhood
Where can you trade GME NOW
I woke up today to an email from robinhood saying that my order I placed to buy GME had been cancelled
Include interactive brokers
My insignificant $20 order I placed last night in the dip was cancelled
STOP SELLING
Trading view doesn’t have pattern day trading restrictions
Time to get rid of hedge funds and options
How do I close my account that I setup last night to buy AMC
Webull suspended GME
Opened an account this morning, now holding a couple $k of GME
HOLD THE LINE
Did as others suggested and filled an SEC complaint
I want in on this
I want in on this
Any against interactive brokers also
Just bought a share with Fidelity's app
This is crazy
This is crazy
Revolut still letting people trade Game and AMC 😉
Is Robinhood not the most ironic name for a platform that is becoming a hedge funds lapdog to protect them from consequences of their risky practices
Everyone take screenshots of the 274
IF I CANT BUY I WONT SELL
Everyone take screenshots of the 274
In
I’m about to sell everything i have there and switch to Webull
Call Lin Wood
After checking like every 10 minutes for the past couple days, my bank was **finally** verified on Robinhood today
Then, 3 minutes before market open, they removed my ability to buy GME
How do we get in on this
BUY SLV NOWWWW
They will allow me to buy prvl therapeutic options, knowing that it was soon to be delisted when they merged with Eli Lilly basically allowing my options to end up worthless
I'm a Robinhood user and was affected by their manipulation
Absolutely ridiculous
This is exactly why Wall Street doesn't let the retail consumer invest
No feedback
Xtb, my broker allows me to buy those stocks, do your brokers allow you
I’m in TD-Ameritrade and they are TOTALLY ducking with sale orders
This is a concentrated effort short interest is now at 122%

Why are we all using Robinhood in the first place
Can non-WSB file claim also
I am in
Where’d we go
Yes we need to file
Someone needs to file for a TRO
How is this not an anti trust/ market manipulation
For me  🙌 💎 patience
I thought Robinhood was based on the guy that gave back to the poor
I think it was limited
They want my shares
I’m in
Where do I need to sign up to be a part of this 
I bought a share of gme last night while markets were closed
I feel you brother
Absolutely things will change
I think it was limited
HOLD TODAY 💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌
So they’re short ladder attacking and we can’t buy back
This isn’t the first time Robinhood has manipulated trading
In for sure
They cancelled my order for American Airlines, which I had put in early this morning- even though I've been buying AAL stock for months
How does RH decide what's in the safety of the people
I put in a buy order to be fulfilled at market open, woke up to a message that I cancelled my order
Not that they didn’t fulfill it, THAT I CANCELLED
Which is impossible, because I was still asleep
Newbie
Sign me up for this lawsuit
How does RH decide what's in the safety of the people
How do I get in
I have audio recording of them telling me that I couldn't exercise my options
I really don’t get how they can not allow buying but allow selling
In
Please send a link
My Robinhood won’t even load 100% lol
Uptick coming
All I know is once they inevitably let buying comeback, 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Good stuff until you only favored gme
You know what it is
I can only buy minimum of 1 share through my broker, wich is to pricey for me
Is anyone else having the same issues with Charles Schwab
I've contacted 3 lawyers this morning, waiting to hear back
Trading 212 is doing the same
This is not acceptable
Start the go fund me for the best lawyers
I have tried td ameritrade and etrade
STASH is also blocking trades
Fidelity let me make an account but not link a bank, so I guess I'm out of luck
With all the new cash flow for Gamestop, I wonder if they have cause here
That's a broken platform issue
Should I sell what I have on Robinhood at this point
You don't have a loss until you sell
No, hold onto it and it will be worth way more in the future
I'd sign on
Every single one of us should be re-evaluating what trading platforms we are using right now
How do I get in on this
We need to do something similar to Ameritrade, this is out right crooked
BOYCOTT ROBINHOOD
Just started the transfer of my holdings in Robinhood to E*TRADE
Go to Schwab, Fidelity, or E-Trade to get GME
Just filed a complaint with the SEC against Robinhood for market manipulation under section 9(a)(2) under the 1934 Act
Submitted to SEC and FINRA
I have 8 shares to do my part and I'm never letting goooo
Woke up today to a canceled order on Robinhood on my GME purchase
Don’t just target Robinhood, you have to target them all
Non-US user here, how do I support the cause
Robinhood canceled my buy order prematurely on GTE stock
Hopefully this isn't a dumb question; is there any chance RH revert their decision and let us buy GME again today
Worth pointing out: catering it to 7 bucks a share make me ready to buy MORE, not less
They can't stop trades forever
I wanted to buy some GME today, but I couldn't because Robinhood decided to stop supporting the stock
Following this
File a complaint against them through the SEC

Where do I sign to be a part of this
BUYIMG ON REVOLUT JUST WORKED GOGOGO GME
Selling now means the hedge Fs win
Etrade no longer allowing opening orders for GME
Filed my SEC complaint
Trading 212 platform has also blocked buying GME shares
I'd love to be part of this but I don't know exactly what you do
I’m not part of Robinhood be it affected the price for me obviously
They aren’t even letting me log in, and when I try to change the verification code setting since they send the code to an old number I no longer have, they say email verification is my working
And now AAL is added to the list of stocks we cannot buy
Is this just Robinhood
I just transferred everything to Webull
I’ll loose all my tendies just to sue these ducks

We need to be coordinated about this
I've filed my complaints and we'll see if anything changes (which I doubt will happen), but sign me on to this
Put in an order this morning for $25 of AMC, everything looked good and then 2 hours later I was informed that the sale was cancelled and tailored to appear as if I had made the request to cancel

The democratize in Robinhood’s mission statement is like the democratic in Democratic People’s Republic of *blank*
Not just robin hood but citadel too
Guys SoFi still let’s you purchase GME
I know this wil get lost in the deep thicket but DOCUMENT EVERYTHING
Edit: Even when you think “this couldn’t possibly matter,” do it anyway
Ally has a message on their site “we can’t show these accounts right now” gues which accounts they’re talking about
So the first time I decided to go all in on AMC BB and NOK yesterday and now wake up to these losses so far
Lawyer up please
Lets do this, we can let them win just like that
Add Cash App to the list
Include the trading platform public to the list
Either we are influential and powerful enough to manipulate the market like they are trying to paint us to be or we aren't even influential enough to get them to respect our electoral support
Stockpile is working for me, in USA
Can't even search robinhood for GME, AMC, or BB right now
I wanted to get into the stonks after this (as i dont know what im really doing at all right now)
RobinHood Made a huge mistake
Buy Silver
Amen brother
Someone get it started
Hold the line @Public

Robinhood R fuk now lmao
Saving this to get tendies later
I’m in, I have screen shots
On top of being overcharged for a stock purchase yesterday, i hope RH rots in hell
Robinhood won't even let me sell if I wanted to
If you have any political connections, start bothering them
It wont even let me search for GME
Can someone please explain to me what is happening and why it's hurting us
GME live-stream
I signed up for an account last night to try to buy this morning and it would not even show me the stock
This has ruined me
WE
I sold all my other positions this morning just to find out I cant buy GME
They are allowing somebody to buy
No way to allow only sales without a buyer
I’m down
I gotta admit I doubted yall last week with the Spongebob memes
Im in for a total a couple hundred shares of BB and AMC, have lost almost 10k this morning
Keep me posted, This lawsuit should be equal to the money lost due to this manipulation
What does it mean they are "restricting transactions to position closing
Dang, I was coming to recommend WeBull, but I double checked and they suspended GME and AMC too
They are only protecting themselves, not investors
I thought we were all holding
Today is the day they ruined their future
I just lost $5000 in 20 minutes
Only sell
The system works
I’m pulling out of this Robinho
Fellow August’s, I’ve been creeping and gaining from your wisdom for the last year
I held 5 shares since yesterday
The amount of times they have suspended it feels like market manipulation
Edit and put a change
Even in Europe it’s restricted on trading 212
Let me hop on this train to since I woke up to GME cancelled order
Isnt robinhood going public
STRIKE ROBINHOOD
Sign me up please
I need to know where we can move from Robinhood
I contacted FINRA and SEC
The app itself is shot to hell
I wanna join
Has Robinhood had any precedent for suspending buying due to volatility
I honestly didn’t invest much but I’m pissed off that this is supposed to be a free market yet they control what we want
No wonder why i was losing so much
Can someone explain to me how this is fair
I have m1 finance and I can still buy gme stock but idk if it’ll take a day to “verify” yourself
Following, this is bs
Buy the dip
Ally Bank is also blocking new buys
Yeah I have 14
LET ME MAKE MY MONEY, ROBINHOOD
I'm in for this, sign me up
Is there anyway to file an injunction from preventing these apps from banning trade on these stocks
I would like to be involved, Info to sign up
German here, cannot buy either
They won't let me cancel orders either
Even if they did, only restricting certain stocks is crap
It’s not
The future is decentralized
WE NEED OUR BIG AUTISTS TO OPEN THE SUIT
WE WILL WILL AND RISE ABOVE
We need a new brokerage
Same thing happened with my broker, Trading 212
I am so down, this is absolutely ridiculous
Nabbed 1 GME and 50 NOK this morning
Idk about y’all
They cancelled my order from last night set to buy at open this morning
Robinhood CHANGED my order
They made us lose money,  lawsuit
I would like to be involved too
This is what CNBC and other media outlets should be reporting
If they thought this would discourage people, it quite the opposite
So
Count me in
I lost everything
Count me in
I'm down, this is ridiculous
I'm down, this is ridiculous
Lawsuit would be nice but switch up to fidelity buy buy buy keep sticking it to them
I'm down, this is ridiculous
Mods, lets start with stopping free promotion of Robbinghood by banning screenshots from them
Anyone switching to webull
Wanted to get AMC this morning
THANKS FOR THE DIP HEDGIES GONNA BATHE IN CHAMPAGNE WHEN THIS IS OVER
They refused to fill a buy order, so I canceled it
Tel me where to sign
If you open an account with a new broker, all you have to do is request the new broker to transfer your holdings from RH
Like George Carlin said, the game is rigged
In
Oh my gourd
Unfortunately brokerages can restrict high volatile stocks from trading, and they won’t do it without the blessing of the SEC
Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post
I really like the AMC stock, am new to retail trading AS OF TODAY, and think AMC has a bright future with or without the opinions of individuals on WSB
I didn't invest much, but I feel cheated by a company that claims to try to bring democracy to people's wallets
This is it
CAN ANYONE BUY
I had an order for GME with Robinhood that got cancelled
Can't by more Nokia either
We need to start compiling legal resources
I don’t know where to buy my stocks at now
This might sound crazy, but we need to get President Biden in on this
Some elected officials have already spoken up in our support
Anyone have any idea how to contact the US President and/or his secretary
STASH is also totally offline and can’t access anything
Tried to buy this morning, couldn't
I'm in
Stash is also not allowing gamestop to load

Does anyone have any proof on Trading212 website when you open an account that you must accept responsibility for trades that you make
I'd like to use this against them when they decided to block trades

I just filed with SEC and complaned to robinhood
I’m going to chase investment now ,it didn’t do any bs like td
Can’t they just say, “you can use another broker, that’s your problem—not ours” in order to avoid any legal ramifications
Probably, but I think the general argument is that it’s not MY problem and only my problem, they restricted the stock for their entire multi-million client base and not the traders themselves
Also TD
They crashed their own website, and are continuously crashing

HOW IS THIS LEGAL 
Kind of new to this, but what would happen if we started buying the “free shares” that Robinhood is giving to new customers
Robinhood also isn’t letting me recover my account currently for NO reason
I wanted to buy this dip
Throw ally invest into the mix as well, won't let me buy the dip
Careful
Is there an E*TRADE VERSION
Count me in
So much for a free market, or even free trading  :-(
IF YOU STILL WANNA BUY, GET FIDELITY, FIDELITY LET ME GET NOK, BB, AND AMC
I wasn’t even a part of all the GME squeeze and I’m pulling my Robinhood account due to this

I'm not sure how reliable The Motley Fool is here, but they claim that Citadel Captial WAS a part of the $2
Where can I buy I’m a newbie but the few apps I tried are crashing nonstop 
My guess us Hedge funds paying robinhood told them they need to stop selling the shares or the funds would pull out and stop buying their market data
WSB COMMUNITY SHOULD QUIT ROBIN HOOD DEFINITELY, THIS IS STRAIGHT UP MANIPULATION
I'm VERY in on this
Maybe a few thousand people could stop by Menlo Park and ask Vlad about it
The search engine on Rb isn’t working either
What are hedge funds ;-;
Don't GME, AMC, NOK etc have HUGE incentives to sue in this instance as well
What is a good platform to move to
Robin Hood is more like the sheriff of Nottingham
Robinhood is not one of us
Hey everyone, I get you are pissed about Robinhood, and it's not them
And those brokerage houses have told Robinhood to block you all, or they will shut down Robinhood
Do you really think they would want to piss off all their users
My girlfriend and I are new to investing and started with RH about 2 months ago
I just tried buying on schwab, is anyone else unable to buy there
Even if you don't use RH, it still damages you when they block others from participating
It's Citadel the brokerage RH uses that forced their hand and made them do it or be shut down
I'd like to join in
I panic sold then changed my mind and it pended “canceling” for the entire halt then sold anyways
Reminder that Trading 212 is doing the exact same thing as Robinhood
What’s the best mobile app to buy GME, BB, and AME shares on

What other trade apps would y’all recommend instead
I’m getting the same result on WeBull
In the interest of mitigating risk for our clients, we have temporarily placed GameStop and AMC Entertainment in reduce-only mode as highly unusual volumes have led to an unprecedented market environment
I had orders for GME that were queued for market open that didn't execute just pisses me off more and more
Filed my SEC complaint
They are activly setting the IV on puts lower to make puts look worthless,  I bought a 4000 dollar put , the stock dropped 200 dollars , and they're trying to tell me it's worth 
Can someone recommend a new brokerage
SUE THEM BOYS WE ARE MILLIONS OF PPL THEY ARE A FEW LETS GET THEM

How is this possibly legal
Aaand like magic we're allowed to buy again
Edit: purchasing was opened up for an instant, the stock jumped, then it was closed again
Can't buy AAL on robinhood today either smh
Any recommendations on an alterative to Robinhood
I've never seen such obvious securities fraud
I’m new here, just been lurking
Thankfully I have an etrade account and was able to buy a couple share of GME
That’s why we don’t use a casino confetti game app to deal with money
Please read, if you are on the sidelines and cannot buy or if your hands are diamond and you aren’t selling but can’t buy more: https://www
Bruh, I literally tried to make my first investment last night, a meager $250 split between AMC and GME
Can someone recommend a better place to buy stocks
FWIW I just sent a message to one of my US senators regarding this
We are both proud Democrats but today we are pleading to you as our senator to continue to resist the GOP and reach across the aisle and do what's right for the majority of American people
Please, senator, continue to do right by your average everyday constituents and make sure Wall Street brokerage companies are held accountable for market manipulation that disproportionately harms average income Americans
Thank you for your time

My negative review of Robinhood on the Apple app Store keeps getting deleted
Is robinhood still blocking buys
Could we not all move the autism to like td or etrade or tasty or something
CALL THE SEC 202-551-2200 CALL NOW THIS IS THEFT
Don't forget IBKR, they are blocking all buys too
CnBC is trashing reddit right now
EToro still let’s you buy aswell 
This is absolute bs
I’m not selling
Same with revolut
Alternatives Robinhood
Should I keep my current shares in Robinhood
How many have transferred and closed accounts because of this
Started my close account process
It’s not just people who are using RobbingHood, it’s anyone that held any of these securities
I put in an order last night for AMC and they cockblocked me in the morning
There are far better brokerages than RH
But what alternative do we have
Whats the alternative
Fidelity still letting me buy
I’ll be there
Robinhood
What's the easiest option aside from Robinhood
Add TD Amertirade to this suit
Anyone know any good lawyers in Chicago for this kind of thing
Haven't used them in about two years but just decided to delete my account
Can we short Robinhood
Check SECs definition of Market Manipulation
I'm selling everything and moving my portfolio
Robinhood is actively engaged in market manipulation- they had no problem filling my overnight trade this morning before they subverted the free market
Meantime I continue to buy NOK etc on Fidelity
Now I’m on Robinhood, tryna get the goods
Count me in
I agree with this completely
I am left to ask though
Other brokers also restrict people buying
I had just downloaded RH last night, but couldn’t get my account up and running till this morning about an hour and a half before market open
And trading 212 doing exactly the same thing
I'm livid
One of my friends dad is a broker and he claims that Robinhood blocked buying because they can’t handle the volume
Does anyone know if other firms sell info like RobinHood does
Why you guys use a third party app to manage your stocks is confusing to me
Would I be entitled to something when Robinhood drove the prices down
Does anyone else see the irony of an App called Robinhood not wanting to take from the rich and give to the poor
Anyone aware of anything similar for Trading212 in the UK
Amazing, I opened an account this AM before reading this thread only to find out that A: my deposit/account won’t be available for 1-5 business days and B: “this stonk isn’t supported”
I'm definitely in
Sorry boys
FIDELITY IS A GO BOIS
Are they allowing you to purchase gme
Count me in
Let me know when it's started
Im in let me know
Blatant market manipulation
I use Schwab and it just "crashed" and didn't "recognize valid stock tickers" for several hours
Etrade is doing it too
We stand United
Bro do you not understand the concept of a stocks circuit breaker
I don’t have a horse in this GME but as an investor I think it’s complete BS what Robinhood and it’s co-conspirators have done
I have vanguard and can buy AMC today
Do we need signatures to start this lawsuit
I have been using the Stash app for a while
What's a good alternative
I have been locked out of Ally all day
Trading 212 as well
If nothing is done about this the people will rise up
I'm really sorry that I can't join the crusade but I'm rooting for you guys
Notice they are not protecting us when it goes down
How can I short Robinhood
What other brokers do people know of that are also blocking AMC and GME
Sign me up
I'm 1000% on board for this
Are there any apps or websites allowing purchase of GME
Vanguard wouldn't let me search for GME, BB, or PLTR on mobile
Those who hold will be rewarded; imagine the demand when buying is allowed again
On the way https://twitter
Make sure we include IBKR and Tastyworks as well, they both went to sell-only for select securities (which Citadel happens to have large short obligations on, of course)
How can we buy right now
Throw tastyworks in this dumpster fire
GME: 120 to 273
I'm in to sign up ✋🏽
ROBINHOOD IS A SELLOUT
What do I put for type of firm, type of security and name of issuer or security when filing with SEC
FYI broker is never your friend
I just closed all my positions on Robinhood and will close my account
Sure this has been covered, but all the “volatile” stocks are blocked on Webull as well
So if I have my stocks in Robinhood and use a different service they just come with me since they are linked to my ssn
I have Robinhood and want to them for someone better, who should I go with
Im in
I can’t trade on Ally Invest either, this seems like a coordinated attack
I put in a buy late in the game yesterday for GME, this morning I got notification on Robinhood saying “you cancelled your purchase of GME” NO THE HELL I DIDNT
Can we do the same for Trading212 in the UK
Burn em down
What about the other brokerages
Who is going to write the book on this
They locked my account and I can't wthdraw
Robinhood just cost me, as an individual, an opportunity at a minimum of $2,900
Closing Robinhood right now
Am I banned
Trade Republic won't let you buy  **GameStop Corp
I wasn't on the GME rocket, but I canceled my gold membership and pulled all my money out
Come on guys, leave a review of Robinhood
They ma haw got a really nasty email from Uncle Sam who knows

FYI Chase YouTrade is allowing for trading of all the "forbidden" stocks
Ally bank also won’t allow purchases of GME
We'll Fidelity is down for me on browser and app
What other platform does fractional shares
Ally is in on this too
Robinhood isn't the only one culpable here
What's cheaper, loosing possible billions and billions of dollars because you got gang-banged on a short
Maybe they're getting desperate
I tried buying AMC after close yesterday and woke up to the transaction being canceled
BREAKING: Robinhood has informed the Houston Texans that they’re not allowed to trade Deshaun Watson
Close your robinhood accounts, the best way to show how you feel is through your money
TD has also restricted gme
I would also escalate these complaints to your appropriate AG’s office of the state you live in
I would send letters to your senators and reps
I just reopened my robinhood acount, they approved me today, only to find out I can't get any tendies
Yeah, well I already had opened one about 2 years ago
This is truly insane does anyone think these brokerages will open back up
Webull is doing the same thing and as of right now Fidelity is not letting people open a brokerage account
I’ll put in money for that
Is WeBull good
Wait
Ally wouldn't let me buy GME either
It's not just Robinhood, it's anyone using Apex Clearing
Fidelity isn’t letting me start a new account
I love how they phrased that I cancelled by NOK and AMC buys
Robinhood needs to feel the heat for the stunt they pulled
Confirming that Robinhood cancelled my orders this morning and are restricting further trades
I'm HOLDING
In the meantime I've applied for an Ally Invest account - they cover your account transfer fees up to $150 (Robinhood charges $75) on accounts $2500 and up
Serious question, what can we expect
They manipulated me, had gme and nok
Well said
Dm me a way to join in on this
I have shares of gme from Robinhood
Webull just suspended trades of GME as well
Imagine being so empty of any integrity that you would rather face a lawsuit than have any morality whatsoever
Canadian here, logged into my brokerage (investors edge), and wow would you look at that, us equities are not available right now, what a coincidence
This is total war
Need to close accounts with Robin Hood and file DSAR requests so you know what information they’ve collected from you and see all the marketing they’ve done with your personal information
I’m in
I’m done with Robinhood
I tried to make a robinhood account and it wouldn’t even let me finish it
It will only let me exercise my BB calls and won’t let me do anything else
Is there anyway we can force RH legally to allow us to trade again
For anybody interested in transferring out of robinhood:[https://robinhood
I was one of them
This is for all Robinhood users or just the ones holding the affected stocks
Signed up for Robin Hood this morning before seeing they iced GME and put $350 in to throw on the stock (after doing extensive research and deciding this is a company i would like to invest in of course), they’re still reviewing my application - how do I stop the review and ensure no funds go in
Add Stash to it too
Leave negative reviews on their app as well
Transferring my shares to Schwab, today
Just bought AMC using my E*TRADE account
They can’t call themselves Robin Hood when they don’t support stealing from the rich and giving to the poor
Citadel Securities (market maker) processes ROBINHOOD FINANCIAL, LLC’s transactions
Other retail trading sites continue to allow trades - this is Robinhood specifically curtailing market action, likely under specific pressure from Citadel and Citadel Securities
Note that although they are separate corporate entities, Citadel and Citadel Securities are owned by the same individual - Ken Griffin
These companies seem to be colluding behind the scenes to block legitimate investment actions by individuals, to their own profit
Please investigate communications between this brokerage and the hedge funds who fund them and would likely profit off of the restricted trading of the security
Where do we go
What other options
Bankrupt Robinhood
Which platform would be good right now
REQUEST ACAT PAPERWORK TO MOVE YOUR SHARES FROM ROBINHOOD TO A NEW PLATFORM, DO YOU NOT HAVE TO SELL TO MOVE SHARES BETWEEN BROKERS
Don't forget about Webull
Its not Robinhood, it is Citadel, they coordinated a take down on multiple Citadel affiliated brokers
A shame that robinhood caved to citadel
I use Stash and they’ve done the same
I do not have Robinhood but this is effecting my holdings
What brokers are still allowing you to trade
They are now canceling all limit sells over 10k per share
How do we get in on this lawsuit 
They cancelled my order this morning that I placed yesterday
I mean it was only $400
I'll join it
I only had M1 Finance when this all started but I still bought my shares of GME on Monday and have held ever since

This may not have come from Robinhood
I bet CITADEL buys lots of orders from other clearing firms too
Is robinhood called robinhood security
Is anyone having trouble buying with TD
Instesd of living up to their name Robinhood, they are instead Robbing The Hood
Robinhoods audience is poor autists like us it’s so bogus they’re taking the hedges side
Ally Invest is doing the same thing as RH, light them up too
This is getting bigger by the minute
May be a stupid question, but what happens to unexecuted calls for GME purchased last Friday that expire tomorrow
Webull is doing it too
I just emptied my Robinhood account and WeBull
In case anyone didn’t see they put them back up but they now aren’t supported by Robinhood
ROBINHOOD FKD ME BIG TIME
I have a bunch of $18 $BB calls that expire tomorrow
They'll take down reddit next
Also in
Thinkorswim is letting me buy
Add Webull to that
Count me in
RB and WeBull are both trying to pull GME and others off the app now a few of the giant trading sites are doing the same I just read about it in the WSJ not sure if its disinformation or not cause I don't trust WSJ at all
This sucks because I made my robinhood account 3 days ago, joined WSB yesterday morning just when the craziness started and was locked out of entering any options for GME

Having read a lot of posts today
Meanwhile, I am holding all my positions for now 
However  **the change which costs us nothing is to walk away from those platforms that potentially treated you badly, without explanation so far
Robbin' Hood
So can I get in on this
Woke up this morning hoping to get more amc and gme
We should sue all the government agencies that are allowing this
We keep the positions for now and move everything else off
Hellyeah im in
I'm canceling Robinhood for sure, but I can't find a place to transfer my stock that's not in on the scam… 🤔
Thinkorswim is good to go👍
If someone wants to give me their referral code for webull I am happy to help out
I'm in
Anybody see Webull suspended the buying of SNDL today as well today
Fukkin' market manipulation
Im late to the game, does anyone have a day trading app they can recommend in it's place
There are more platforms blocking, just had my experience with eToro
This is gonna be good
How do I leave Robinhood without selling my shares
I only have one share of amc but I’m in
Is there a comprehensive list of the companies which have put this block in place
I just sent my transfer request
You can trade GME in tokenised form on the trading platform FTX
Make a change everyone
Can you guys wait to sue robinhood and close the app down until i get mt tendies out pls thanks i will now switch to fidelity
Let’s go
What about other apps
We are gonna make this in the books
Isn't owned by Schwab
Down 7k because of these gremlins
I'm probably going to move to a different platform that allowed trading throughout all this
Robbin the hood
I want ALL in on all this
Honestly, we've all known for a while how crappy RH actually is and how they profit off skimming off our trades, have lag issues, delays in market data, etc
What mobile app can we use to BUY MORE
It’s gotta go
I lost money as a result of robinhoods actions
Hold and buy more $AMC and $GME
Where is Robin hoods headquarters
And Trading212 - did the same thing
Robinhood is now saying stock is not supported from them
But how will I ever be able to showcase my autism anymore
Add Stash to this mess as well
You can't leave, the delete my account in the phone no longer works and if you use a PC you havbe to submit a REQUEST to customer support for review
That’s crazy
Just to shine light on this situation some more, robin hood will just play the "oh, we're a discount brokerage, hedge funds are not our customers, they are customers of investment banks" card in order to avoid collusion
And for with the SEC about Citadel
SIGN ME UP
Trading 212 is doing the same thing
Very disappointed in robinhood but it will take weeks to pull all my money out
I left Robinhood long time ago when I discovered Webull
I couldn't even log in for the last 2 days
Both sides broke the law, the delusion is real in this subreddit
If this is found as market manipulations, are shareholders that didn't use Robinhood able to sue for damages
Apple store has disabled reviews
I thought I was the only one
Any suggestions as to where I should go
How do you buy stock if the organization selling the stock doesn't have enough to sell you
I literally dropped $40 dollars last night only to be told on open that I wasn’t allowed
Besides leaving Robin Hood, what do
I dont get it, what has happened
Rich folks playing life on easy mode
Who should I do my retard trades through if not robbinhood
Left today
Other websites
Robin Hood has a parent company
It's also cashapp doing the same
I'm gonna be honest
This is not the first recent incident that should make you question if Robinhood is the right platform for you to use
Robinhood
I use etoro
Please go after eToro next, we international retards are being shut off too
Trading 212 did exactly the same
I signed up for a RH account today and put money in before I realized they won't let me buy GME stocks
If I create an account  on Robinghood right now and they dont let me buy, can I join the lawsuit
We bought shares of Gamestop
The terms and conditions RH users have to agree to specifically state that you agree to let them do things like this unfortunately
To be honest, I don't feel bad for all the people losing their money
I have to sell all my stock to get out of Robinhood though right
What’s best alternatives to Robinhood
I’m leaving but where do we go from here
I put my last $100 into Robinhood to buy NOK last night and now I have nothing
My account is still pending approval

Y'all broke ETrade
Webull too
I finally got my account linked to Robinhood only to have them turn off buying today
I just opened a Robin hood account today added funds and can't put it to gme
Cancel the money transfer in the app and use another trading platform
I will but my diamond hands won't let me sell
POWER TO THE PLAYERS
I'm done with RH

How do I transfer my stocks from rh to a different stock ap
GME available on sofi again
If they arbitrate because they’re pussies then if a few thousand anons on a Chinese basketweaving forum can make them pay all the legal fees for court cases
Pretty sure all of them
Also, if there's any link to a sub which can help me learn more about the market basics and how to start trading in general, plis let us know xD

Stop giving awards
I’ve always called it Robbinghood
All my funds were in Robinhood, I'm in the green but lost almost 40%
Now for the important part - they are losing money, not loosing money
How do we prove this in court
How do we prove this in court
I would have been fine had they froze trading but only preventing buys is BS
As soon as I get accepted for Webull I'm done with Robinhood forever
You did it
I'm from r/all , so can someone enlighten me please elaborate what is "robinhood" and what happened exactly 
We need to put together a guide or walkthrough of how to leave Robinhood and how to take your stocks with you
Who are you guys going through to trade stocks now
And it wasn’t just Robin Hood users who were f’d over
UGHH they better not even THINK about IPO
We are just ITCHING for blood
I tried to buy stock last week and Robinhood suddenly fined me and set my instant deposit limit to $0
How do we know if Robinhood is selling our trade data

Would it be unwise to try and buy more gme through Robinhood
Going to take days to transfer funds- or wait until next week to reinforce
Started my account with Fidelity
Nice if AOC and Ted Lieu, Elizabeth Warren (
Its already being done www
UNITED AIRLINES STOCK IS STILL THERE LETS GOOo
I have a transfer initiated for TDA- it’s just unfortunate timing have all my funds in Robinhood right now
You didn't get instant buying power with TDA
No buying power
Where’s my $5000+ crew
Exactly
Can you see this comment 
YES
I’d like to join even though I don’t use robin(from the)hood
Yeah they canceled my buy order
Just wondering - what's the best app to use for shares now Robinhood isn't a viable option
I’m sorry if  others have already stated this but perhaps individuals who are not directly involved can also lend their support
I will cash out of all my stocks if nothing is done
What do I do if my shares are in robinhood but I want to 💎🙌
Edit: not looking for any financial or sexual advice
Are there tax costs to switching
I just got a email about how my order went through
Where should we go to trade though
What the hell makes you think you can get through the system
What happened
So what's a good app that I should use then
No kidding
Where is the best alternative
Just sold all my shares and they will not let me transfer to my bank due to increased traffic
Hello Charles Schwab, AMC and NOK
Happy to join yall :)
If an exchange restricts buying, does that mean people cannot exercise their call options
I wasn’t allowed to buy shares today
I need in on this
I think the loss of RH BUYERS also effects the price of everyone else who bought those securities
RobinHood is self clearing so all the decisions they made with respect to restricting trades in certain stocks was in their best interest
RH restricted boomer stock like SBUX , GM, AMD too, wtf
It’s like Wells Fargo is in on it too
This move from Robinhood was very bold
Switch to fidelity
I have Robinhood with all of my investment how do I move to a different one 
What’s a good alternative to Robinhood
So where did you all go — KRAKEN
What do you guys think about MARPS, can we earn big money on it💎💎💎
Darn right it is
I think TD Ameritrade also pulled this to a smaller degree
Need to add stash to it
Signed up for fidelity after their stunt
Thoughts on that automated lawyer app -  do not pay
Where is everyone buying now new to the stock game
I know I'm old school but I've always used Etrade
RobbingHoodlum
Dm me when lawsuit ready
This gives me hope that one day I will be able to afford treatment for Chronic Neurological Lyme Disease
Looks like they're letting you buy again
WallStreet is all mother of pandits so do not let cannibalism scare you expressing your opinion
We should pressure Robinhood and other brokers to go with future or keep dead Sheldon Adelson casino machine
Do not stop fighting for what is right, short sellers were planning to shut Tesla
We should be careful
I could have made some money with GME and wanted to buy AMC, they blocked both and returned my shares of AMC
TDA has been restricting buys on OTC stocks as long as I can remember trading
Let OTGLY release a patch for this 💩
What other trading platform would you recommend
ROBINHOOD WAS PROTECTING WALLSTREET BIG INVESTMENTS AN WE ARE PAYING FOR IT
ROBINHOOD AN OTHER FIRMS WILL PAY FINES THATS IT AN CLOSE WITH OUR MONEY SO CLOSE ALL ACCOUNTS SOON BEFORE THEY FILE FOR PROTECTION OR YOUR MONEY WHATS LEFT OF IT IS GONE
I need a link to more info on this
LEAVE ROBINHOOD NOW
Just messaged Robinhood that they lost my trust and loyalty
What broker apps are not restricting trades
New boy on this particular block can anyone advise the best trading platform to buy certain shares, I do have an account with FXPRO but I think that’s only forex, BTW I have only just stopped laughing, the hedge funds are still crying LOVL it’s about time change is in the air, I do wonder about the world’s financial reset and when this will happen, chance for them to really finish off the people
I agree, we should all 100% move off of Robinhood
I think everyone should leave Robinhood, after what they did this past week I don't understand why someone would continue to use their platform
Dont forget trading212
How can i join the lawsuit
Can i join the lawsuit even if i don’t have gamestop shares 
GameStop CEO: “these 13 stocks, you can sell but you can’t buy, but we have thousands of other stocks you can buy
Noob here
I don’t think you get what I’m saying
What about her
Google play store does not show the comments on how Robinhood screwed everyone
RH does not allow users to buy stock , still 
Citadel is their main customer , users (us ) their product 
What’s everyone switching to
Sounds like a lawsuit
Does anyone know how to transfer my shares from RH to Sofi
I hope that they hold everyone accountable for this
Can anyone tell me why there is Talk about 3d printing
Hey Guys, why not Aphira
Anyone else having problems withdrawing funds from Robinhood
They screwed me with KODAK
Don’t leave Robin Hood until after they issue their IPO
Where do I take my stock 
Just wondering why are people not mad at Interactive Broker
Robinhood, the only app that will let me do anything right now because of waiting for approvals and trying to exceed limits on cash app - which I haven’t done — ONLY LETTING YOU BUY 1 SHARE
UPDATE - I was able to cancel the $350 transfer I just tried to initiate - thank god
Proving once again that there is one set of rules for the elite that the rest of us dare not copy  for fear of facing prosecution
Hey there redditors
Use me as a GME STOCK BUY BUTTON FOR MONDAY
ROBIN "STOLED FROM THE " HOOD
I lost too much money from this
If you're still using Robinhood, why
Someones gonna get fiiiired
Am I mistaken, or did RH not stop trades on stocks back when they had to tap their entire 200m line of credit in March due to
Did they prevent trading of Kodak
There's been other examples of extreme volatility that they didn't "protect" us from
Horse manure
They also closed my options when the stock was at its lowest, 2 hours before the market closing time
The restrictions made their way into digital currencies as well
Keep Robinhood App for evidence
Criminals
Hmmmm
I've invested in pharmaceutical for the past year and witnessed the shorts play in SRNE causing lots of people to panic and sell servicing their agenda
In times of tyranny and injustice when law appresses the people, the outlaw takes his place in history
To the real robin hoods #modernrobinhoods
I switched from Robinhood to Charles Schwab last week - I’m interested to see how many people actually left Robinhood
Where to go
Why stop at Robin Hood
What other apps does everyone use
Where to go
Etrade also shutdown trading  in the middle of this
This whole situation is so internet to me
If anyone is interested; I am aware of a prominent attorney who is representing individuals who were unable to place trades for AMC or GME last Thursday
Anyone looking for an attorney
They just updated the app - any thoughts on what new features they added
I've no problems with calls for RH's head, but my question is where were you people in October when 2000 people got their accounts hacked
Filed
Robbing the hood
Robinhood is run by crooks
Your are so right
Opened a Public app account and purchased 4
I went to moomoo
Which is the best broker for option trading small amounts
I deactivated my account
Better check your term agreement
Showed me the clause in my contract where  they retain the right to stop or limit trades in etfs mutual funds etc
IF you think the thoroughly-corrupted courts will save us from TPTB, you are not watching
Just signed up for robinhood, going to get my free stock, sell it, and close my account
Does anyone use SoFi Active Investing
I use cash app and it works just fine
They were so blatant and obvious too
Doesn't mean squat
Zero issues trading and depositing with TD Ameritrade
I use TD Ameritrade and I can’t buy AMC
I think that Robin Hood would not steal from our pockets, we've worked all our lives
How can I short Robinhood
So I’m need to investing
I had gains SITTING IN MY PORTFOLIO that I couldn't trade
I was prevented from signing up for an account as was my boyfriend
Fidelity and Webull
Where do I sign 🤬
Robinhood = Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy
I loved watching their playstore rating drop from a 4
We took a deep dive into the David vs
Hey guys, don't know what to do, been trying to contact robinhood for 3 weeks about my debit card being restricted and contact support
How is robinhood so retarded as to having not enough funds to secure trades
Cumcumcumcumcumcumcumcumcumcumcumcumcumcumcumcum
Off topic: So Dan Bilzarian was all lies
LMAO
I am taking them to small claims for max 10k in California
Be aware, Robinhood charges a $75 fee to transfer out
Ridiculous statement
Spam their business phone number taken from their EDGAR filings (SEC website)
Lose money
Robinhood has locked my ability to withdraw funds
Robinhood, you mean robbing the f'n hood
Vlad's company "Robinhood" stopped me in my tracks so many times over the last couple of months as I tried to buy those dips
BS
BS
BS
He is actually Robbing the f'n Hood
My robinhood account is in day trade call, can I close my account while in day trade call
I want to add one more thing I discovered just today
Zomedica about to blow up
First majestic all the way
Robinhood
I agree this is wrong but they had no other choice
F××× Them I move all move shares out of there
Thus 
I canceled several limit buys just now but my own money won’t go back into my buying power
Let’s roll
So should I not use RH
Only way to make Robinhood bleed is to drain it dry
Still waiting on Decision from First Lawsuit
When I get a portfolio worth transfer I’m out
How i can close my stuff and move to webull
I wonder if someone could tell me the exact time RH is gonna sell my options for, on Friday
I lost a couple $K last Friday, as usual, and was thinking maybe RH buys them from me then sells them when theyre ready
Just throwing it out there, seems like a legit place to ask a real question
Go get them
What about them selling my shares of AMC one day 4 months ago without my permission they closed out my position on 3 stocks that day right before big gains in those by the end of trading day
Robinhood is the slime of commie eastern Europe, dump them forever
If only sell is allowed and this is not market manipulation, what is
Another time they did not send me the notification of buy back action of the company which would mean 60k profit
Got out of RH few months ago
You mentioned something that looks like crypto
That's a great question
Gonna leave Robbinghood soon
Whatever happened to this
I've an account with them, but never transferred any money or did any transactions
Have any of you switched from Robinhood to Webull
For last time
What's the latest
What would you guys suggest is a better alternative for non-pro, beginner investors like me
How’s that going
Did anything ever come of this
They are all In Cahoots with all the other Counterfeiters 
Government included
They are all In Cahoots with all the other Counterfeiters 
Vlad took home 9% of robinhood marketcap
Looking for the earnings thread
Did this ever went through
Why haven’t they been sued yet
Happy cake day
Why didn't people leave Robinhood after the first big scandal broke when they froze people's accounts to protect big Corporations
New here
I'm genuinely in love with this man
Congress: Will you buy GME at current price
DFV: Yes, I just clicked buy button as we speak
My dude doubled his stock position
Yes or no
YES
Yesterday he was asked if the price was attractive at $42 or so and he said yes without hesitation
HE'S STILL IN
Did he buy 50k more shares
THE KING IS BACK
Just txt me when you want me to drop off the wife
HE BOUGHT THE STOCK
HANG IN THERE
HE'S BACK AND HE'S STILL IN
I AM NOT A CAT
THE RETURN OF THE GAMESTONK SAVIOUR
WE COMING FOR YOU 300 BOYS
Hope for those apes who bought at $300
Yesss, doubled your shares from 50k -> 100k
You did amazing yesterday at the hearing
Edit: Thanks for the awards, very kind
Honestly I didn't think I would ever see a post like this from DFV again, not because he sold or didn't believe in the stock, but because of the lawsuits and testifying in front of congress
HES STILL IN
Went to new by accident SAW THISS
HE DOUBLED DOWN
GameStop is the nation's most popular platform for esports, sports and stock wagering
DFV, the world's wealthiest person, is still holding
The man went into a Congressional hearing
This does mean he was the only person who didn’t lie yesterday
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
I LIKE THE STOCK
I’m still in
Hes back and still holding
Edit: HE BOUGHT MORE
DFV you are an absolute legend
You may have never intended for it to happen, but you will forever be remembered as a patriot among the likes of our forefathers
You are fighting for the little guy on the biggest stage that exists
And not only are you fighting the good fight
DFV I love you
Welcome back DFV
Obligatory and gross edit: Thanks for literally my first award ever
His tweet to Jim Cramer just now
HE IS NOT A CAT
In short, we like the guy
This is all the DD you need to make your way to tendie town
HE BOUGHT THE DIP
WE BACK BOYS
I'm jacked to the TITS
IF HES IN, IM IN
NOT ONLY DID HE HOLD BUT THIS MAD MAN BOUGHT MORE GME TO THE MOON🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Not only is he in but he almost doubled his position last time was 50,000 and 500 now 100,000 and 500
IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN
EDIT: Keith, if you read this please give me a sign
Added 50k shares
I hope every GameStop has a 1:1 cardboard cut out of DFV at every location right when you walk through the door
Great job yesterday
He doubled down his position
Love you DFV
IF HE'S STILL IN I'M STILL IN
DFV the fact that you doubled your holdings is amazing
THE LEGEND IS BACK
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
You probably won't read this, but dude, Thank you
Bought another 50,000 shares
WOW, 100K shares
Let’s GOOOOO
PLEASE LIBERATE ME FROM MY 300$ COST BASIS OH GAMESTONK MASTER
This is causing GME to moon after hours lol
I’m a 60 year old woman with three young adults your age and supporting hubby and them
Edit- 1
He doubled down
HE BOUGHT MORE 🤌🏻
Welcome back
Memes and GME aside, you were very professional, confident, respectful, and genuine at the congress hearing
The absolute definition of "practice what you preach"
He boght the dip
IF HES STILL IN I'M STILL IN
I have been in Reddit for around a decade with different accounts
Congress: Yes or No, would you still buy the stock at $40
DFV: Yes, it is still an attractive stock
You're really someone who represents the American dream man
What I love most about this is that when juxtaposed to all of the snakes in that hearing yesterday, this single action proves to the world his honesty and sincerity
Droppin’ signs like Crosby droppin’ babies
Seeing 43mil to 17mil would destroy every single one of us
We’re all still hanging in there
He was always in, I will be always in
He just bought 50k more gme shares you retards
If you want to call others bagholders you clearly had DFV's balls resting on your head for too long since you have permanent brain damage
Jesus Christ he is back
God dammit this hard work up voting every comment in here
It’s an attractive price
I’m not a cat 🐱
Hang in there
Just some advice, though: Don't buy an iPhone with any of that money
You’re a cool cat
Not only did he hold strong he doubled his share positions
Welcome back legend
Buying $15000 GME at market open Monday
Those still holding at 50 or above, we’re coming for you
IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN
He now has more SHARES in GameStop than he had US DOLLARS back in 2019
He’s locked up I’m locked up
Sorry to hear about your sister, DFV
I needed this boost today
In short, we like the stock
So he not only knew what yes or no question is, he also wasn't lying about buying more
Boys, I am holding @ $314
I don't participate in hero worship
For those who slandered DFV 🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾
HE DOUBLE DOWN, I DOUBLE DOWN
What if GME ran up, got the attention of congress on the hedge funds, then the squeeze REALLY happens, now they can't use their tricks
WSB CALLS FOR AID
Since posting this gme price went from -
For SEC / regulators or those who attempt to profit or take advantage of DFV's post
I don't think I've ever appreciated a stranger as much as I appreciated DFV
He's not a cat
Pretty sure dressing up as Keith Gill will be a thing come Halloween
I can’t stop looking at this ~$2 million double down
You added 50k more shares from your last post
I just want this man to be filthy rich for the rest of his life
Half you retards sold GME
Leeeeessss GOOOO
This is what an actual hero looks like fellow 
Dude your message of "hang in there" with the bandana on the corner was so beautiful
You did amazing at the congressional hearing yesterday
Legendary
Please be my wife’s boyfriend
Annnnnd GME is spiking
You bought 2million more in GameStop
HE LIKES THE STOCK
Who is buying GME on Monday
Amen brother
WOULD YOU BUY GME TODAY AT 45
He's back
I pre ordered the new Zelda and Mario golf from GameStop today
Anyone here to see if he posts again
You were awesome yesterday
That's it, I'm buying more on monday
Welcome back
Mr
Congressman: would you buy $GME at current price ($45
THE BEST MOD RETURNS
DeepYouKnowWhatValue
I actually got prengant yesterday hearing you speak
I know there are a lot of comments on this but if you read this DFV, your appearance in the hearing yesterday was something you should be very proud of
You handled yourself with poise and dignity in a way that the other extremely high net worth individuals could not (except Huffman, he was also great)
Everyone knows you're going down in legend, and quite frankly your friendly and inviting disposition in a position of what could only be described as extremely stressful is something that most of us could only dream of
If DFV doesn't win man of the year 2021, I no longer believe in the award
If he’s not a cat, IM NOT A CAT
HANG IN THERE
And this single post just made GME pickup crazy volume in AH
You were purrrfect
So gme part 2 or what
Sending positive vibes
IF HE'S STILL IN, IM STILL IN
THERE IT IS
Added 45,000 shares
IF HE’S NOT A CAT, I’M NOT A CAT
I thought he sold some
I have upheld the faith even in my current holding position, but seeing this update has given me an extra boost
Thought it was hilarious when your own representative cut you off after you said you still like the stonk and would buy it at $45 and started talking about the turn-around, new hires, branding, fundamentals
GME is like the abuser in a relationship
Spent all day fixing my house’s drainage after roofers destroyed it and flooded my basement, seeing this made me smile
I have no choice
Would you buy it at this price
IF HE DOUBLES DOWN, I DOUBLE DOWN
I’ve said it before
I FINALLY FEEL WE ARE GETTING ALL BACK TOGETHER AFTER THE LAST 3 WEEKS OF FUD AND UNCERTAINTY 
The currently highest awarded post on Reddit (to my knowledge) is a post from APNews announcing that "Joe Biden is elected President of the United States" and currently has 11,018 awards
Ahh now suddenly WSB is full of support
Amen, amen, aaaayyfaaaackingmen
I'm long on $GME because of your DD, not the meme
The absolute pair of cohones on this guy, being investigated yet still buys 50,000 more shares
Wow
This was the confirmation bias I was looking for
Being patient is key
Came here just to see the mans gain porn
LONG LIVE THE KING
Madman
Will DFV play himself in the inevitable movie about this
DFV have 4 out 5 most gilded post ever on Reddit now, with biden winning the election being the most gilded
This is history in the making boys
Dear DFV, due to legal constraints I'm sure you're doing far more lurking than posting
HE DOUBLED DOWN
Would you buy at $45
You were really excellent at the FSC hearing
Precise, and honest with no equivocation
A huge contrast to to the HF and Robinhood guys
I've bought more GME today because I like the stock
Get ready for all the bandwagoners to come back after claiming DFV sold
Dfv was the whale that brought us back above 40 at about 2:52pm EST today
Who would sell 50K shares at that price
He pretty much just held my hand, and told me it’s going to be alright
DFV gets progressively more interactions with each post
This dude is the most trustworthy, reliable weather proof guy I’ve ever seen
Sir I’m heterosexual man and I want to have your babies
I added another 25 shares today at $39
Post again daddy
Please post tonight
The warchief is back
IF HES STILL IN, IM STILL IN
Yooooooooooooooooooo
If DFV has million number of fans i am one of them 
I thought I’d take my GME loss as an expensive lesson when I saw my 💵drop 80%
My memory is blotchhy and distorted from years of falling out of trees and eating fermented bananas
I bought back into GME earlier today @ $44
Looks like the train starts from here again
Time to buy GME again, most undervalued stock
WE NEED THE UPDATE
The guy's a time traveler
UPDATE TODAY PLEASE
THE PEOPLE WANT TO SEE TODAY’S GAINZ
You’re the only god I believe in
I am also not a cat
THIS IS THE WAY
I am a cat btw Woof Woof
Legend, you make this pandemic a little more bearable for retards like us o7
Why isn’t this the most upvoted post of all time already
Inspiring, I’m going full retard on Monday
If I was retarded enough to buy at 300 you bet I’m autistic enough to buy at 40
He bought the DIP
Wow man over 100k upvotes
IF HES ~~STILL IN~~ DOUBLED DOWN, IM ~~STILL IN~~ DOUBLING DOWN 🖐💎
GME on Monday 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Most awarded post in the history of reddit
DEEP
Going to break the record
As for me, I like the stock
If he’s not a cat, I’m not a cat
GME had been nothing but honest
Why yes senator, my balls are absolutely enormous
Double the uncertainty
SEC CAN YOU DEEP THROAT
I'm jumping back in too on Monday too, I'm too retarded to walk away
Oh an urban ape
And my axe
Fuuuuuuck yes, the momentum is back boys
The only post I've ever awarded
KEITH GILL IS BETTER THAN BUFFET
I really hope he does, to double his investment and have it go up again 3x in value in less than a week is legendary on top of his legend
If he’s still in I’m still in 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
YESSSSSS DFV 🙌💎❤️🙌💎❤️🙌💎❤️🙌💎❤️
Im holding 
He had 50K stocks on Feb 3 YOLO update, now he has 100K stocks
Based on the $2 million he's down in cash and 45,000 shares traded, he  bought at around $44, which puts his buy at close to the time he was in the hearing yesterday
This dude's a wsb first ballot hall of famer
DFV not just “hanging in there”
Dang
GME up 35% pre-market on Monday
Best Buy signal in the market ❤️
The squeeze has yet to be squoze
Just a cool +20m by AH
How
HOW
All you you people that trashed the “bag holders” for the last couple of week
We need an update 🚀🌝
If he’s still in I’m still in
HANG IN THERE 
Let me start from the beginning, when I was a boy in Bulgaria
HE"S NOT A CAT
It's so beautiful
IF HES STILL IN IM STILL IN
Just bought some more
THIS IS GOING TO BREAK THE INTERNET
Doing the math, he bought 50,000 shares today at 38
I pray that one day I will have as much chad power as this man's left baby toe
GAMESTOP
If DFV were POTUS the world would be such a nice place
Buy and hold
Real question:  why no 🍌 award, tho
This is now the highest awarded post in reddit history
I am now living my life vicariously through DFV’s YOLO 😃
Savior we need a daily update today
He doubled up
He’s still in, I’m still in
I just wanna say
IF HES BUYING IM BUYING
I shouldve sold my apple to buy more of the stonk i like
I hope vlad sees this
Ahahah as soon as I saw GME suddenly spike again, I instantly knew that DFW posted an update
GUYS HE BOUGHT THE DIP HE BOUGHT THE DIP OMG OMG
This message just made GME skyrocket
WELL 9MIL FOLK
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
Your testimony was amazing
Wow
WTF **1650 awards
I am leaving this comment so I can be part of this historical moment
Lmao also at gme +3$ AH since this post came out
Bought more today right after seeing DFV's yolo
I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me
An hour of hedges and shattered shorts when the Age of WSB comes crashing down, but it is not this day
This day we fight
By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Retards of the West
DFV is my hero
I am tearing up
I saved my free award for this
What I love about DFV is that he unites the people
It’s funny that the only people that will actually understand the joy this brings me will never be more than a user name on Reddit to me most likely
DFV 2024
Have been sad that it seemed the GME experiment was done, only to come on here on a glorious Saturday and see a fresh DFV update and front page being all GameStop again
I would have loved to see DFV point his camera to his screen and hit buy when he was asked if he would buy more GME
Is this now the most awarded post in Reddit history
The catalyst
Amazing how he did YouTube videos introducing his thesis on gme
The man said he would buy
That’s a bold statement cot, let’s see how it plays out
As for me, I like the stock
I think almost every one who trashed was a bot
I’m sure some were bots
You can't change my mind
I am not a cat
I LIKE THE STOCK
Tendies for everyone
It takes titanium balls to do such a thing
He's from the future
This is the catalyst we were all waiting for
He just proved he remains calm under pressure and answers questions directly
Some of his other posts went over 3k
It’s on its way
I’m giving you a 🍌, because I spent all my money on more gme today
And thanks for the banana
TOTALLY
I can afford to do both, but I agree on the sentiment
You asked for it man
Let it be my fate
There are 32 now
You have my upvote and support
I'd vote for him
Why yes senator, my balls are absolutely enormous
The bestest bot
They are literally under a microscope
TLDR:  They shouldn't because they are under a microscope and the released statements to congress
They said they have enough capital now so they can't or their fuked
Man i wish i could afford to stare at millions and hold
If he is here then i don't see a reason to tremble with fear
GME IS BACK Y’ALL
Hey man
Gme 750 AMC 250 hold and buy
I AM NOT A CAT 🐈‍⬛
HE’S STILL IN
The king is back
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
IF HE’S STILL IN, THEN I AM STILL IN
I’m buying more
Looks like he mooned the chart with this 🚀
He did say he would buy the stock at $40, and HE DELIVERED
This post alone caused a market spike Lmaoo
This gives me life
Congress: Would you buy more
You dropped this: 👑
I’ve never wanted to get another man’s name tattooed on my body so bad
We're back on the rocketship lads 🚀 🚀 🚀
History in the making
I have to say, this man is an absolute genius
I love that they asked you if you would buy more at this price and they laughed at you when you said yes because they figured you were  lying
HOW MANY OF YOU NON-PUSSIES ARE STILL HOLDING
This dude is a true legend
It was such a pleasure to watch you during the hearing yesterday
DFV moves markets now
Sooo we gonna push this again
A wizard is never late, nor is he early
AOC probably bought GameStop shares and was trying to ask Plotkin if he still holds short positions
Real anylyst rating
We should all band together and elect DFV for Congress
I watched the entire testimony before congress
When I logged on and I saw this
This man bought $2m in shares after his hearing
MASHALLAH THE KING HAS RETURNED
GameStop needs to hire this man as their official spokesman
This guy's balls are as big as GME's potential
I am wet for this man
I watched the whole thing
Guess I’m hopping on the $GME rocket again
WSJ picked up the story 
Hang in there
When I heard him, under oath, say "Yes" to whether he would buy the stock at its current valuation
Get this man a seat on gme board 🙌🙌🙌💎💎👑
Only DD we need
Now all the pussies are gonna buy again because there Dady got some more
This kitty just roared
I’m buying more on Monday 
He told congress YES, he likes the stock, and he would buy at a current price
My mind is telling me NOOOO
Just when I thought I was out, dfv pulls me back in
DFV is from my hometown
You're a legend DFV
THIS IS OFFICIALLY THE START OF ROUND 2
Guys, open up yourself a beer, a wine bottle, light up a joint or whatever you prefer
IF HE IS DOUBLING DOWN, I AM DOUBLING DOWN 
Hi from Scotland
Melvin, Citadel and Robinhood went to the hearing to blame other parties for the Gamestop trade restrictions
Imagine going to war with all the guns in the world but forgot to bring ammunitions
When you thought legend couldn't be better
Editing all old posts to remove content to show support for devs during the API controversy
Just when I thought I am out, they pull me back in
Remember to buy some gme
The best part about your testimony was the cat picture in the background with the message: "Hang in there" with red bandana draped on top
I awarded this and it’s become the most awarded post in reddit history
DFV is a true American hero
Return of the king
This post should be the highest rated for the week and its not on the home page
He is Still in
I bet DFV is so so happy rn about doubling his position
How's it look right now
Update
Look into trader psychology
Another thought, if you saw it go up 100k and had unrealized gains and didn’t sell - why does a number make you feel a certain way
GME 1000 is not a meme
This Post Malone caused a market spike Lmaoo
Just showing even basic competency during a video meeting set him apart, this is legendary
That's what I'm sayin man the amount of idiots not on mute was staggering at times
Most of us retards never stopped
I hear that
Watch the CNBC interview from Wednesday with that brokerage CEO
I must b retarded i never spell check or proof read
Yes he did
I am not a cat
I think hes taken gain previously
He’s never lost anything
Lesssgooooo
Time stamps pls
Why yes senator, my balls are absolutely enormous
Those 100k shares are worth about 15 million right now
I'll take 10 shares off his hands
GME 1500 minimum :)
Can’t wait to see an update tomorrow
Charts show a $285 open tomorrow based on volume
I see he double downed
DFV Balls of diamonds
I Bought more GME purely because I like DFV
My intention is to reduce the float
I want people to consider buying more GME and selling covered calls and buying more GME shares with said premium
This will inflict theta decay because options expire
You can get 50% cover calls if you do ITM options for 1 year right now
Buy and sell them
Consider doing this to reduce the float if we cannot rally enough diamond hands as we keep getting paper hands
Heck if you think this is fair value sell march 50 dollar calls and keep rolling it over if we do not get a short squeeze
I think this would be a good strategy in bleeding the HF from GME
Now you wont get 100000% gains but you will get to reduce the float so the HF wont be able to do too much unless they keep breaking the rules and since SEC is on this it will be much harder for them as we keep reporting FTD to them and complaining to congressmen and women
The more press GME gets the more valuable GME becomes
GME can grow into a 5000 stock on it's own merits with Cohen as CEO
GLTA
He likes the stock
All hail the king
The return of the king
He’s returned
Definition of 💎👐
RETURN OF THE KING
HE STILL LIKES THE STOCK 😭
WE LIKE THIS MAN
I am wide open pls
IF HE DOUBLED DOWN IM DOUBLING DOWN
I love you Keith Gill
He wasn't lying when he said he would buy at these levels
Mods
One guy is accused of SEC fraud, and that guy was the only guy that looked pleased to testify yesterday
Not only is he still in, but he double downed
It's not very often you get to witness a legend in real time
Stop wasting money on awards and put them into GME season 2, it looks certified fresh
Thank you for letting me witness this
I offer you my wife, sir
This was the most brilliant post-hearing action he could have made
Regardless of winning or losing on this trade or any other 
I’ve never seen anything like it
I've been doubling down the whole week, even before this was released
What the Hedge funds may not realise is that the lower they manipulate the market to drive down the price
I wasn't even interested in GME back in january
Honestly
Is this why it's up after hours
HE BOUGHT 50K MORE SHARES
Are we coming back to rescue our 350+ comrades
We have reached peak meme status
My cock has literally never been *this* hard
The chat is going so fast no one will know I am holding too
Is this what it feels like when a woman finds a guy attractive
The man, the myth, the meme
If he doubled down, I’m doubling down
I’m glad I could witness this history
I really hope RC hires DFV as VP of investor relations for the love of all things holy
He will literally be everybody’s wife’s boyfriend
Singlehandedly brought back the name Keith
DFV you don’t know what you created
Finally, something that promotes GME that gaybear mods can't delete
Thanks for helping me hang in there DFV
HE DOUBLED DOWN
It would be cool if gamestop became a success
Go look at his last screenshot
He had 500 in calls and 50,000 stocks
Now he has 500 calls and 100,000 stocks
It was so great to see the every day man at a congressional hearing
Looks like he bought *today*
About time there's a GME thread
I’m literally cry-laughing and wiping away tears waiting for the subway
The squeeze the sequel
Wow what a time to be alive
Love you man hang in there😊
That headband is going in the Smithsonian
Let's make this legendary update the most upvoted post in Reddit's history  💎💎
I cant wait for Doubledown Monday
I swear he has to have the highest karma count on Reddit
Doubled down, what a legend
In @234 let's change this company around Ryan Cohen
You are a true man of your convictions
Just
DFV has a crystalized Dimond 20ft King Kong C\*CK and he should've put on the table for all of congress to appreciate while he collects their wife's numbers
I am quite a broke guy but I bought $30 a few months ago to hold strong with you guys and I'm gonna keep holding
This man is jesus
We don’t deserve DFV
I feel like the only proper response to this is doubling my holdings on Monday morning
I feel like the ball is in GameStop’s court
THIS GUY IS AN ANIMAL
It sounds so silly but this post felt like it lifted a weight of my shoulders
Honestly guys, just keep this in perspective
Probably one of the, if not, the greatest post on WSB right here
I like the stock
You’re never gonna see this homie
I cannot get over it man
You are an absolute legend
Idk about you guys or this dfv guy
Just looked at this person's profile
Any recommendations for strike price and date
If you can try to do march 19 right before earnings
So for strike depends on your cost basis
March contracts 50 dollars still paying about 10% or 15% for 40 strike
I sold 2 puts 40 strike GME is still making money I sold it 1 week ago for 8
They want something from us so they will only rent it not own it
I shall name this OPERATION: REDUCE FLOAT
You have done an excellent job at wasting my time
I got modded
Try to sell itm leaps if you want to reduce float as much as you can if not buy shares and sell calls for March or something for a price you comfortable with I'd say 50 and then if it gets near there roll it to next month
I'm theta more or less
If you bought today at near lows of 40 that is 10% and 15% if you do 40 strike
Theres a word for that but he's taken, he has a cat
What did you buy at
No
As for me, I like the stock
I truly hope he becomes a billionaire
I love you both
Paywall:/ any chance to share the article c/p style
Edit: I’m all for paying for journalism, but I’m currently subscribing to 5 newspapers and…
Edit 2: full disclosure: work in a newspaper myself, so 3 of those subscriptions are payed by my employer…
This is the way
This isn't a man, this isn't a legend
Just commenting to be a part of history
I only bought an extra 100 shares but will buy more Monday
Our hero 🥰
IM MORTGAGING MY HOUSE ON MONDAY AND THROWING IT INTO GME BEFORE THIS ROCKET TAKES OFF AND LEAVES ME ON THE GROUND
You are already a living legend
Will this event mark the start of a new bull run on this stronks
DFV is an absolute legend
Guys according to fintel, the number of short shares available is only 1
I'm not a cat either
If he is still in, I am still in
Monday I'll buy the dip too 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
ALL HAIL OUR FEARLESS LEADER
A true legend
BUY BUY BUY
I ain’t gay but I’d kiss this mans tip
I think you just broke Reddit’s award record
After the 🤡Huizenga laughed at him for giving an honest answer, DFV doubles down
Hero
Normally I would tell ppl to stop paying for rewards on reddit and put the money into GME
I’m here for this
Highest awarded post in Reddit History
He likes the stock
BUY THE DIP
You are the reason I get up in the morning
GameStonk
LEGEND
Why is this not showing in the top posts this week at wsb
I like the stock
Came back to remind myself
I think the second wave is on its way
Lol I gave up on GME
The first person to ever answer a "yes or no" question to congress with a "yes" or "no"
Give this man a seat on the board already
It’s ok DFV
You do your thing when you’re ready, today, next week, mar 24, whenever
I like the stock regardless
If everyone of us doubles, what will happen
IF HE’S STILL IN
Now even more
The balls of this guy he deserves it
Show us
Anyone new here
We need another update to get us going ;)
HE IS BACK
It's been a strange few weeks
The downs
The dazzling glow and hushed sounds of a soft kitty to guide us
Were we foolish to think we could even scratch the toes  of Goliath
My buying power greatly reduced by now, each share hurt even more but I continued to paddle upstream and try to average down my position
I finally stopped buying
The dust began to settle
The last glimmer of hope faded into the night
I was the bag holder
From the debts of darkness, something told me to check in with my Apes
And THIS is the post I find
Buying more on Mon
Can’t imagine the price action on monday
This madlad doubled down
Finally
DFV THE PEOPLE'S CHAMP
HE BOUGHT 50,000 MORE SHARES
IF HE'S NOT A CAT, I'M NOT A CAT
HE DOUBLED DOWN AND BOUGHT 5OK MORE SHARES
He told us yesterday that he would absolutely buy at $49 and he put his money where his mouth is
YOU ARE NOT A CAT , YOU ARE THE GOAT
HES BULLISH
His average stock price is $26,79 am I reading this correctly
I’m literally speechless right now
Is that why AH it spike by 6%
I just go all in
I know no one will read this at the rate these comments are going
Am I supposed to be throwing up with an erection
DFV has a hint of Saul Goodman in looks and mannerisms
Keith
I reclaim my diamond hands
Looks like he bought the 50k tranche at $38
IM RECLAMING THE STOCK
One things is for certain
Congress: GME is clearly over valued
DMV: Authority is not given to you, stewards, to deny the return of the King
His authenticity is palpable, because of this post and his demeanor during the hearing
Really needed to see this
We shall have our tendies on the moon brother
This is truly the way
All diamond hands
He sold man
I am so stoked about DFV coming back that i read this in its entirety
You’re not alone, I believe there are many lurkers   like myself with a similar story to yours still holding (and buying) on the sideline
Love this
Is this a poem
We see it m8
I am not a cat
Looks like a cost average on the additional 50k of about $38
Oh captain my captain
I like the name
My 1505 shares at $195 average don’t feel too scared anymore 🤪🤪🤪
RESPECT 
Not only did he say “I like the stock”, and not only did he reply “yes” when asked if he would still buy it, he bought $2M in shares today
THE KING DOUBLED DOWN
I was here
I like the stock
I think i might cry
Can wsb delete a thread with 100k upvotes in 2 hours
You’re not a cat
Some of y’all are saying, “he’s back
All of us degenerates will be buying more shares on Monday
God bless your kind soul 🦍
If he is buying, i'm buying
Winner winner tendie dinner
I am not a cat i like the stock

Edit: ooops, it’s 69 mio shares total, not 14 mio (day’s volume) when I looked
I'm tearing up
So this was the "hang in there" 
I only joined Reddit recently after hearing about the gme craze

Cheers 🙌💎
If he moved it 5% up, that really is amazing
THIS DIAMOND HANDED BEAST HAS CLOUT
I'm glad he's still with us but guys please, don't invest thinking this is a sure thing
DFV is still holding millions in cash that if the stock does crash, he's going to be set for life
I'm reading a few of you boys using second mortgage, college funds and just money you don't have to emulate him
Please don't
Where can i buy GME
I feel great about my $44 cost avarage now
Feb 19th was my 52nd birthday
If it goes to the moon, that amount is what I'd call life 'easing' from bill stress
I'm down -80% But seeing this gives me hope
I live in Sweden, and we can still buy
Is this the most awarded post on wsb

We need an update with his gains from today
DFV lets grab a drink, I live in the area :-p
Where’s your update
Does your wife have a girlfriend yet
You gotta post an update my dude
If I am reading this right, the 100k shares he just bought just increased $14
He bought 50k more shares when it was at $49
When I grow up I want to be DFV
HANG IN THERE
First of all, I just want to thank you for the really important update, It's such and important update and I'm really glad you asked
Lets post and see some green
At a certain point, you will own GME, they should add you to the board at least
This is the most awarded post on Reddit
Congrats on most awards on a post my man

The Lord Hath Risen
I just chucked my keyboard across the office

It should help ease my 200 usd avg, and this tells me hes expecting the stock to still go up
Im in too deep already on gme, too late to back down now
IF HES STILL IN, IM STILL IN
You’re words yesterday were so electric I made a song right after the hearing and sampled you king
My whole portfolio is DFV

This goes to $10k/share and then he’s in the billionaire club
That settles it, this has to go to $69,420 a share so DFV becomes the billionaire he was born to be

Keanu Reeves is definitely playing him in the movie that comes out from all of this

He is the leader we need
Yes and based on his previous updates from 3 weeks ago he bought another 50,000 shares
Should we be buying pre market or at open
How about both
If you watched any of his videos, you’d see he has nothing to worry about
Is it so wrong that my wife bc wants to pay the man

I enjoyed the hearing so much
ALL HAIL THE MAN WHO MADE GAMESTOP INTO WHAT IT WILL BE
THEN YOUR NAME IS MELVIN
If every Wall Street better bought just 6 shares we’d own more GameStop than exists
Is DFV still holding, Yes or no
If 50K shares was more than enough to make a floor, the liquidity could be low, and the stock appears to be trades in low volumes in An attempt to keep the price low
I was wondering if that could be possible to game that, with little to no financial risk
Lets call it the inverse reverse ladder attack
We are gonna need an update boss

DIAMOND BALLS
I can’t believe it
I feel so much better about averaging down now
IF HE'S STILL IN I'M STILL IN
Is this how legends are born
Who’s buying on Monday
Unreal, but real
Stories of DFV will be told in eternity
We like the stock, we buy the stock
This speaks ridiculous volumes
This man really does walk the walk
Oh my gourd
As for me, I like the stock
This is godly
Return of the king
Lol all the citadel/rh bots disappeared after the hearing yesterday
THE KING IS BACK AND HE BROUGHT MORE SHARES WITH HIM
There are legends and there is DFV
Your execution leading up to yesterday and now this, well done Kieth
HE’S THE MESSIAH
I’m actually scared for him now
Anyone else do the math
He needs to buy a new house to fit his enormous balls
Well, DFV doubled his position to prove his actions are right, looks like Melvin and Citadel need to double their short positions, unless they are not confident in the fundamentals
Is that TODAY
I am a married woman, not your boyfriend's wife and I am falling in love with him
If you guys looked closely when DFV was speaking during the hearing you could see his anger
Wow this inspired me so much that I'm selling most of my other shares to buy GME
This is like when Warren Buffet releases his new positions and everyone clamors in behind him
Good to have you back soldier
This literally can't go tits up
I love him
Thank you for this amazing adventure dude, it's been amazing witnessing it 💎🤲
What’s the record for most awards on a single post
Legendary
The last two weeks was so difficult without you, our hands are heavy holding these steel balls
DFV you don’t know what you have created
The WSB logo should be changed to a dude with slick brown hair now
LIKE A BOSS
You were the only one who answered straight in this hearing
He's become too powerful
Can someone calculate how many awards are here in GME share units
This guy isn't going to stop until he literally owns GameStop
We love you DFV
All hail the king
So many awards
He is not a cat
IF HES IN, IM IN
Return of the king
I'm now convinced that were at the end of days because DFV being among us is the second coming of Christ
Freaking amazing
IF HE IS STILL IN I AM STILL BUYING MORE
LONG TIME NO SEE, but we have at least one thing in common : WE ARE HOLDING THAT BANANAS 🦍
THE MESSIAH RETURNS
To the moon 🦍🚀🚀
Get this man back up to 50 mil

That's $2m worth of opinion, right there
Hang in there

Ok, he is walking the talk
THERE IS A GOD

Greatest of all time

Diamond hands
Godspeed Mr

Looks like you had a side bet going where you said you'd buy 1 share every time RH says "thank you for that question" and ended up here
WE
Oh captain, my captain
If he’s still in, I’m still in
Take us to the promised land
Omfg he added
Return of the king

He bought 50k more shares i bought 5 more
Jesus man, you’re a legend
He is not a cat
This gentleman is not a cat
IM STILL HOLDING
I think this is my favorite part of history that I’ve ever been alive for
For as long as reddit and even stock market will be around, you DFV will be cemented in the rest of its history
As for me, I like the stock
You pwned them in congress
HE STILL LIKES THE STOCK
I guess you’ll never read this post mr DFV, but you did amazing at the hearing yesterday
But the time I finally got to buy in GME was at $38 (AUD) so I got to buy at the dip
Edit: US dollars, not AUD
The king was welcomed back with 10% uptick in $GME
I know you didn’t really plan on being WSBs figurehead as a middle finger against the entire financial sector - but you’ve handled it incredibly well
Glad to see you back
DFV not a cat 😺 priced in
I am not a cat
This is the way
Calls are much riskier but can be much more profitable if they hit
I am not a cat
I’m buying let’s ride the wave
I now have 💎🍈🍈
I can’t remember the last time I saw someone use the word pwned
No
No
The Return of the King
God I’m so hard right now 🍆💎🍆💎
Literally one of the greatest investors in the last century
I still believe in GME and i‘m holding

Smart move to buy GME then go on national TV during a congressional hearing and giving it good press
My
I started investing because of what you did with gamestop, thank you

He literally put his money where his mouth is
This guy
This is the way
DFV is my hero
Ayy what a legend
In the end dfv will own all the shares, his real plan is to own gamestop
Turns out the bag us late comers are holding it's his giant nut sack
Ngl the king bought in so i will too, 2K on Monday 🚀🚀🚀
Bought the dip and used a congressional hearing as a platform to shill the stock
If GME hits $1,000 per share before March 19th I'll get DFV in his red bandana tattooed on my inner thigh
IF HES STILL IN IM STILL IN
IF DFV DOUBLES DOWN, I DOUBLE DOWN
If he’s still in I’m still in
I’m seriously inspired lol what happens next
This crazy
HF are scared now, DFV is the goat
He held, I held, we held
Is anyone else enamored that Keith and Vlad look like they could be twins or clones
I love it
You’ve gotta be kitten me
Let’s get these shorts out of these low price ranges so GameStop as a company can thrive
What a great day for WSB, and therefore, the world
To me, it looks like the GME story is not even close to an end
IF HE'S STILL IN I'M STILL IN
Someone make a DFVCoin and call it a day
Tell my wife i said hi
The absolute cajones on this dude are crazy
If he's in, then I'm in (although the two are unrelated)
I AM NOT A CAT
RESPECK
Does this mean people r buying back in

You are a true American Hero
Fly me to the moon 🎶
Yes or no
He is no cat
What can I say
God amongst men

Hang in there
The eagles are coming
IF HE's IN, I'M IN
If there is one thing that this hearing spotlighted it is that there are a lot of bumbling idiots “working” in congress
This is Hollywood Movie material mark my words
This is the way
Oh yeah, this is happening again
Bros richer in rewards and karma than GameStop 😂
My wife asked me when shall I drop her at your place 
Hell of a ride
If he's still in I'm still in BABY
He is not a cat
We like the stock
And somehow this post is only 90% upvoted
Commenting to be a part of history
The man, the myth, the legend
HERO always arrives late
Just as a matter of interest, presumably the hedges that bought in with the intent of killing GameStop are still losing money, since the value has not dropped to 0 like they wanted
I think its important to point out he bought 50k more shares from his last post to now
You are a legend  and savior of free trade 
DFV has guts and balls
OK, IM BUYING MORE ON MONDAY
Double down
Dude absolutely crushes the Congressional hearing and goes back to posting the next day
You did such an amazing job at that hearing

Thanks
I am not a cat
Its the most awarded post in reddit history
Theyre so far in the money im not sure if the extra you get from extrinsic value accounts for much
You think he'll pick a new stock
Or just stay with Gamestop
Can you at least wait a few minutes after the bell rings so I can get some options in while they are still cheap
This is not MP you turd simply stating my opinion , my prediction, and what COULD be
When Jim cramer yells in TV this stock is a buy
Can you add his double down to the compilation please

BUY THE DIP BUY THE DIP
This guy is an absolute legend
Where do you put your gigantic testicles when you explain to congress that you’re not a cat in that gamer chair
What a mad lad
Judging from his last posts, it seems he has never sold any shares (only cashed out with the options he has bought along the way)
IF HE'S STILL IN I'M STILL IN
HE IS A GOD AND WE ARE MERE MORTALS IN HIS PRESENCE
GOD SPEED YOU RETARD
IF HE'S IN I'M IN
You love to see it
Guys remember what Mark Cuban said
His fundamentals weren’t built on a short squeeze , they were build on him believing the company will revamp in the future
Hey look, unlike other “witnesses”, DFV was honest and did increase his position
In other news “no we locate shares first to borrow” & “no we have always abided by the rules
MY HERO 🥺🥺
Holy shiz
HES STILL IN AND BOUGHT MORE
Brother, your statement and testimony yesterday were sincere and powerful---an amazing reminder of the real obstacles and incredible journeys behind the curtains of our anonymous internet personas
Enjoy that beautiful New England snow this weekend
Mr

God bless you sir
No the calls just give him more leverage to exercise and buy more stonk at 12 dollars if he likes
Thank you
A call option is a bullish contract (you think stonk go up) to buy the stock at a certain price (the strike price)
I'M RECLAIMING MY TIME

KING OF THE APES
I have no idea what this is chart showing, or what the context is
I do know about Reddit buying GME and bankrupting a bunch of hedge funds that had shorted it
Uuuuuuugh I'm erect
He is and will be - legend
On a serious note I also believe Gamestop has extreme upside in terms of its brand, mail subscribers, reputation, number of locations and employees
You heard it here first
MR
He represented the sub - and reddit - extremely well
Dadddddddy
DFV has bigger cajones than my wife’s boyfriend
Let me in the chatttttttt

Can I ask: if the hedge funds were happy to break the law to prevent a short squeeze once, won't they just do it again
Still in the gme, baby
MEAT IS BACK ON THE MENU, BOYS
This is the way
I hope monday i will see a gamestop megathread
For DFV so loved the stock that he YOLO’d his only begotten tendies, that apes with diamond hands not blow up their accounts, but have rockets to the moon
Someday I'll tell my wife's boyfriend's grandkids about this
I wonder what kind of weekend Melvin is having
OMG WTF HES BACK
Thank heavens
He likes the stock
Someone explain why he's still buying to a layman
LOTS of reasons
One, it's a bargain in general
Four: it makes his testimony in court look that much better, and makes the opposing testimony look that much worse
Five: This will catch the attention of GME board
I'M RECLAIMING MY TIME
I had a feeling
Where’s my stimmy
Yo quero mas gme
I love the stock
I buy the stock
I hold the stock
Not financial advice, purely theatre
Can be this guy the president of the USA already

He's a genius, when his options exercise, itll average his position back down
The Gamestop board should get DFV on their board
This proves it

Can’t wait for Monday
He buys I buys because we like the stock
GAME STONKS
HE'S BACK
I like the dip
Been one hell of a Friday with work and life curveballs being thrown but seeing this post legitimately put a huge smile on my face
DFV you're the Chad Vlad if you in I'm in
You deserve it all, nice job on the Hill this week, as well as an obligatory fick you
I’m getting chills saying this again boys
Monday is a BUY
If he is still in I’m still in
Don’t worry, the silver award was free from Reddit
At this rate, DFV is going to be a board member soon
Does anyone know what the most awarded post on Reddit is
Well, we know exactly what percentage of the sub is shills
After a long week of working my bag off, I get home tonight, open Reddit and this is what I see
I’m buying more
Edit: NOT ON ROBINHOOD THOUGH
He’s back
AMERICAN HERO
Goes on hearing
Tells them under oath "Yes, I would buy this stock right now
Morale of the story
Waiting patiently to hear the news of some more short sellers destroyed in this process
Who’s my daddy
Bro what an absolute legend 💎🙌
Nice job in front of Congress, bro
Believe in yourself
THE RETURN OF THE KING r/lotr
Shortly, he likes the stock
As for me, I like the stock
I can’t even upvote the post it’s frozen
Lmao sounds about right
Me too
If people would start to buy it again like before it would jump right back just sayin
I watched most of the hearing and decided to double my position
I don’t have enough to buy more but I’m still holding it and I bought at 180$
Amazing
What a legend
Talk about putting your balls where your mouth is
Power To the player💎🐵🐒
Can we start a spam thread for the algos
IF HE'S IN IM IN
When its all said and done this man was up 40 million and didn’t sell legendary
A man of his word
The board for GME has been quite
Congrats on solidifying your spot on the top of WSB hall of fame
The legend just ruined the weekend for Hedgies
Nothing but respect to this humble and smart dude
This guy's balls are made of Unobtainium
Did his buying of the stock made that huge jump in the price
Making me buying an additional 3 measly shares today look like a retarded retard
What more is there to say
I love you DFV
Looks for deep values, has deep values, likes the stock
Tomorrow you can tell them you doubled down because you like the stock
S
If he's still in, I'm still in
I’m so happy I’m around for this
Honestly DFV should be given some honorary role in GameStop for bringing in so much publicity and loyalty
I am not a cat
I dont wanna see any cucks, bots, shills, anyting tryna talk down on this
One life to live
I am so honored to exist within this dudes existence
I love you DFV
From $46M to $17M
God I love this guy
Guys I know this sounds crazy given that he just doubled down and we’re all high on those sweet hopium fumes
We were in because of him
Bro you are a legend
Double mine on Monday
WE LIKE THE STOCK
There we go buying more 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I wanna see this conviction on AMC too haha

You are a god among men

Chuck Norris fears DFV
MY MAN
Welcome back
Hero's do exist
He is not a cat
Haven't seen any DD posts lately
His magic 8 ball told him the RIGHT thing to do
Could a kind soul out there please explain what the details of DFV's 50k call options
Well time to sell puts on GME next week
Just bought 500$ of GME today
This was a pleasant gift upon this apes entrance to the world stage
Burning candles at the alter to our god
The legend is back
Bought 100 more shares
They say the only thing more breathtaking than the enormity of the Himalayas is this man's balls right here
Welcome back mate
Cmon guys where is my credit I doubled down i
Would you buy Gamestop at its current valuation
Why it isnt upvoted by a million
Say no more
At this point GameStop’s CEO should step aside and let DFV take over
As for me, I like the stock
As for me, I like the stock
Perhaps a renaming of the customer loyalty program is in order
EDIT: or the Diamond loyalty program of course
This needs one of the face swap gifs like the Rambo scene
Cohen should offer DFV a position on the board
I agree like how could you not
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN💎🖐
I really don’t know of anything that has made me this happy in the last year
It is imperative we get DFV to start teaching the children immediately
Welcome back, Chief
This man should be on the board of directors of Gamestop
I just bought 100 @$42~ after i saw this post
I'M GOING IN
I bought more on that dip today
I needed this today
I wonder if anyone at Gamestop has contacted Mr
Swooooooon
Maybe he does belong here after all
I literally love this man
Return of the king
The king 👑
This has to be up there with the most upvoted posts of all time
LEGEND
As for me, I like the stock
Mr
And just like that i was hooked once again
He’s working his way to majority shareholder
Can I get a "I LIKE THE STOCK"
I think he likes the stock
HES BACK
Note the usual abundance of "flaired" users usually insulting people for holding GME absent on this thread
At this point If I were DFV I would not care about the money because I’m already an immortalised legend
Ok, I'll buy 2 more shares
The stock looks very appealing to his particular being
This gives me vibes of when Twisted Sister's, Daniel "Dee" Snider went to congress to defend Rock Music
Oh captain my captain, I will buy some more on Monday cause we like the stock and believe in the fundamentals
OMG
It's almost like he likes the stock
Is the madness starting again
The greatest plottwist ever
This guy should be the logo of Wsb
Faaaack I wish I had a quarter that much to throw in
In short, I like the stock
This man is a national treasure
And incredibly handsome
I’m in love
When asked if he would buy at the current price of $40odd he said he would and he did, a man of his word
Here is the thing I don’t want to speak for him but the fact that he is doubling down at this price has to mean he thinks this thing is going beyond the moon
You are probably one of the coolest people on the internet man
Now this is the kind of movie I would really like them to make, it sure feels like it could be the new Braveheart
Go DFV
Those calls had some crazy premium
The great thing is DFV has a Mrs DRV already, so we can all go calm our wives boyfriends down
Double HF trouble
Okay i need to know how much money those awards are
Can you imagine if DFV hyped GameStop up so much that people stopped looking at it like the next blockbuster
IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN 
When I say you are SUCH A INSPIRATION
I’m hanging in with my 125 shares
I like the stock

Thank you for blessing us all with “I’m not a cat
I’ll quit my job right now and work for you
Yes, all I seen was RH, Citadel and Melvin not answering questions, and elected officials just going through the motions
Great I added little too
WELCOME BACK BRO
When do you want my wife to come over
He's like a superhero
Kudos dude
Old times or GOOD times ;)
It’s seems these days the old times were the ONLY good times
Hope we gather the momentum now that our man is showing the way to the moon
As for me, I like the stock
Very transparency winner

This mf lost 40 mil
Remember
Remember: He was at a congressional hearing yesterday
Why does this matter
That being said if you are investing money you can’t afford to lose in a meme stock you might be too retarded for even this sub
Some people really need to hear this
Why
WELCOME BACK BROTHER
The legend appears
His computer is so hot rn
I MISSED YOU DADDY
I wonder if he bought during the congressional hearing
MODS PIN THIS
Doubling down in his position is a great idea tho
He didn’t buy more because of a squeeze
Right
Remember if this squeezes big and hard, the money being redistributed is sourcing from retail investors working-hard-money in the first place
Might’ve
If anyone is wondering about what's the exit strategy here, the answer is
The amount of awards this post and comments have is just retarded
GME finished the day above $40 thanks to this titanium balls move right here
Yes we should do what we have been taught
Yooooo we need a yolo update🥳
SENSEI WHERE IS THE UPDATE
Like how do you guys even have the money
You gotta work longer bro
I read a thread here with a bunch of people in the comments talking about making $200-300k/year in the medical field
Why is it 
Like 80 %of the order flow has 
This brave man continues to fight even with his condition
But when the world needed him most, he vanished
Gme is at its lowest $42
Petition for Keanu to play DFV in the movie
I’m selling at $69420
He seems smart enough that even if gme crashed to $10 he could just make it back
He got asked repeated if he would still buy and he said yes, under oath
He hasn't lost any money at all
You can't file taxes on unrealized losses
Yeah that's poggers and all but he couldve made like 50 mil if he wouldnt have been so autistic
I think you're underestimating the value of the admiration of a few million gambling retards
No, he gained $12 million in cash and still hold 100k stocks
He only lost if you count from the top, not his starting position
There was no reason to leave all of that money on the table
He made millions by staying in when most of us would have cashed out much earlier
He has a HUGE following, and a cult-like brand now
He already had a huge following
Patience friend it shall return
That’s not how it works
Are you genuinely handicapped
He good
The commission can attempt to use this as proof he has the ability to solely manipulate the market price through Reddit
Right, so when ARK sends us the email of what they’re purchasing and selling
But he will end rich, unlike everyone else that bought in at 400 and still “averaging down cuz our leader is still in”
You jelly ya farkin twit
Jelly of who
You're not even the same guy dood
I still wanna know
It’ll go back to 400s imo
There’s a lot of new money here than don’t consider DFVs cost basis, they think this can hit $400+ again when that wasn’t even DFVs initial intention
Think it’s more for the people who joined here a month ago and are shouting “if he’s buying more I’m buying more”
I hate this sub rn, all common sense gets downvoted
This sounds alot like what people were telling me when I held through the drop from 18 to 11 back in October/November
Look at this post and now gme’s aftermarket jump lmao
So
He never recommended it as a investment opportunity
Because neither of them manipulated the stock
I mean wtf are you talking about
So are many others including me, but that doesnt change the fact that a lot of people blindly follow dfv
And GME made him rich
Who says we need to be rich
He wasn't when he started
My girlfriend will be rich soon
You didn't say anything except an obviously self-fulfilling prophesy doofus
Wait, I'm not rich
Though getting less so by the day
I realize that most of you do zero research
Thank you for your wise advice with your no karma barely used account
He worked at some big insurance firm
I'm not glorifying this dude
Not everyone who works for an insurance company makes bank
He’s the first person in his family to get a degree idk what you’re talking about
Aye maybe that's what it was
Wake up bruh
Gill & Vlad is the same person

I liked what you had to say yesterday
I am harder than a diamond in an ice storm after seeing this
Oh for sure, much different
I even initially got in at 9 solely based on the fact I believed in the bull thesis, and I still do
Plus once your masters at Melvin and/or Citadel are forced to actually and fully close their positions, regardless of what price they opened/reopened them at, the price will rise
The Robinhood board should elect you new CEO
Brings a tear to my eye 😂💎👌
RESPECT 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Witness him
Proof is in the pudding despite all the crazy posts, non-believers, and doubt
At this point just buy the company and be the CEO
Thank you DFV 
Thank you for your service
Posting in legendary bread

A king among men
So this explains why Reddit is broken right now
I appreciate the question… Growing up in Bulgaria…
IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN
A real god among men
Double dip down deep for the real value
If you look at previous posts and the “price paid” you’ll notice that he’s sold some of his shares and options but has clearly added to his position
Hanging in there
THE LEGEND IS BACK
If hes still in im still in
Holy schnikeyz
Talked about the hearing all day yesterday to my friends
I like the stock
Because of you my friend, we never left

You're a legend we love you
Back up we go
Have I told you lately that I love you
He's from the City of Champions which means that he's got balls (50K new shares) and brains (12M cashed out)
When this is over you can pay for a transformation and become that cat you always dreamed of
Great Googly Moogly
Your song has restored my strength

We are not financial advisors, no one here is able to professionally tell someone to buy a stock
Legend has it, every time someone sits in a quiet room and buys more gme, dfv will call your phone and whisper

If you do the math he bought today at $38
We thought the diamond balls were a rumor, a joke
This man is the true based god
I wonder if he waited for the failure to deliver report from yesterday
The shorts not squeezed and the gains not won
The Tendieman makes his regular call to encourage the captain crew and all
Thank you for being the only adult at the hearing yesterday
I don’t have any tattoos but now I kinda want one
Thank you for the update
The messiah has returned
I feel like this needs to be pinned to the home page of Reddit

Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post
What is the plan
GME just jumped 10% immediately after his post
What are we doing
This is his defense against any lawsuits
And suddenly faith is restored and I’m glad I held
