Someone needs to open a GameStop across the ny stock exchange 💎🙌
Bro wtf
This is the hype we need for next week
WE LIKE THE STOCK
This is easily one of the greatest things to happen during our lives
Just when you think this sub can't be any dumber we buy Times Square billboards flexing our idiocy
Edit: Hey guys, it’s a compliment
This just gets better and better
APES TOGETHER STRONG
Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you
Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your GME shares
I LIKE THE STOCK
This is not financial advice
What a legend
I don't belong here really, I am a 63 year old Grandma who knows really nothing about the market
Can't stop won't stop
Not enough 🚀
This is great
Help GME beat earnings for Q4 by buying something from GAMESTOP
WOW
I never thought a revolution could allow me to participate drinking wine in my pajamas and not get hurt by bullets and tear gas
We are human-ing SO HARD right now
LEGENDARY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
STONKS ONLY GO UP 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
We’ve gone mainstream baby
I couldnt partake in the greatness with a kid on the way
How many chicken tendies did that run you
Bought two billboards in LA
EDIT3: DIAMOND HANDS TO THE MOON WITH ROCKET EMOJIS WORKS if you buy billboards make sure to chat u/someguyindeutschland with proof to get listed in the Times Square post
You guys are INSANE - website traffic is blowing up right now so if it doesn't work, use this link: [https://portal
As a Marine , I bend the knee and thank you for your service
I think a lot of hedgefund managers and financial institutions are fuming mad
I got in 8 days ago, money is tight right now, and I YOLO’ed in with $1,000 which is a lot for me
To me, this is more than $GME
WE LIKE THE STOCK
THE REVOLUTION WILL BE ADVERTISED✋💎🚀👨‍🚀🚀🚀💎✋💎✋💎✋
Still waiting for Papa Elon Musk to label his rockets
This is great
Do you think we can get a Superbowl ad next week
Well
You have the support of the Norwegian people, stock trading platforms in Norway was overwhelmed by all the GME buys from Norwegians
The Age of Boomers is ending
You guys are building up some crazy momentum sticking it to the man
Even if we hit 4 digits, HOLD 💎👐🏼
POWER TO THE TRADERS
Incredible
Guys I am thinking of putting about $35K CAD into GME right now
Please post any donations / good will gestures to r/wallstreetgivesback
POV: you sorted comments by new to see the last comments before the lock
This post was flaired as a YOLO so it's on the YOLO list
I like the stonx and milkshakes
Tyler Durden inspires us all to this day
First rule of ape club, u dont talk about sell
Imagine having lost billions of dollars and you have to see this on your way to the unemployment office
Welp, they reopened comments and I cannot remember if I already commented on this post or not, so
I was here
Reddit Recap LESS GOOO
What does it say
FYI this actually isn't in times Square, it's a few blocks south of Central Park
Are my upvotes disappearing
HOLD
MOST UPVOTED REDDIT POST EVER
WE STILL LIKE THE STOCK 💎🙌
Costs $18 an hour
This
Might be $1800/hr and only that cheap because traffic is way down
Y’all are forgetting there’s not much happening in Times Square these days
Yeah that can’t be the price alone
Only $18/hr
Ohh how badly I want to contribute
Extremely Volatility you piece crap the markets have been volatile from day 1 of the pandemic it’s ok for the average joe to go broke but god forbid a greedy billionaire goes broke all hell breaks loose put The CEO of all those who restrict trading from short squeezes or any freaking stock in jail
Total retard here
Still here Apes
The next few episodes of south park are going to be hilarious
I live in NY, can confirm
Are we still buying $GME
Full Support from the European 🦧 buy more GME AMC tomorrow 🙌💎
Top upvoted post of the year
Man, difficult to believe that this was a simpler time
This was in my recap
Him legend
Honestly if they have to liquidate to cover the market will crash
Market rotation into $GME
It's the year 2042
I already liquidated all my mutual funds in my roth a few days ago
APES STRONG TOGETHEUR
I bought up GME with my IRA
Bought it in my HSA
Absolutely YES
The risk/reward is simply not worth it for traditional investing right now, imo
I have been debating shorting some S&P 500 as they might go down if hedge funds liquidate some holdings to pay the interest on the short positions
VXX is the way to play market volatility
Yo most upvoted post of the year 🙌🤙
I love you guys
I like the stonk, and I like how it's on the billboard
A+
Best use of money ever
Wow
This is rad
WE LIKE THE STOCK
You should do it somewhere on Park Ave/5th Ave, as that’s where ALL THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE
Bought GME at 350 and AMC at 14
Can we please kill Nestle next
Now this is coming from someone who doesnt have the means to invest in this movement
Please, only invest in what you are willing to loose
Allow those who have the means to make this work without losing their livelihood make their stand
This WILL work, but dont kill yourself in the process
If people are wondering if its too late to join GME, just tell them $320 IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
GME 🚀🚀🚀 AMC
We should all pool together to buy a 30 second super bowl commerical
Amc all the way folks
I never would have imagine a WSB post could reach top post of all time but here we are you beautiful retards
Wtf you’re the second top post on r/all
This is the second most upvoted post on all of Reddit
You’re not last anymore lol u/flapjack626
I WAS HERE

What is “Brrr”
Brr is the sound a money printing machine makes
Thank you
Check u/pidgeonlover comment history, he said it himself
This one looks like it's "off" times square (in one of the side areas, when I was living there I'd guess a couple blocks away I'd say), certainly not [one of these](https://www
Even the most expensive one (the NYE ball drop one) is only [$1-4 million a YEAR](https://www
That’s 13,000 dollars a month
Check u/pidgeonlover comment history, he said it himself
Yeah, that's true
Last I saw was that mayor and his wife dancing on New Year’s Eve while we all were on lock down
I read earlier in the pandemic that the cost of advertising in Times Square dropped significantly because there was no people there, so I think it's believable
He’s not renting the whole hour
Sure he did
Questionable comments in WSB
It's not Times Square
No idea, guy who bought it said it’s $18/hr and dirt cheap
Probably meant 1,800 or 18,000
Can barely pay a guy to spin a board in a banana costume for that price
Lmao right
From the guy who bought the billboard
I think you may be confused
Check u/PidgeonLover comment history, the guy who bought it
Yeah, I see
Check u/pidgeonlover comment history, he said it himself
We hugged the site
This reminds me of Cards Against Humanity’s infinite hole digging
Lest we forget the [Ron Paul blimp](https://reddit
And the op got 4 years of Reddit premium from the awards
Truly a Reddit moment
If all of the large banks are short even a single share, the suck will be on the order of trillions
I don't think the stock price will go to infinity, I am saying that the price at some point will be N/A
No, but if the number of shares in the pool become lower
I am not sure what would happen if there is literally *no* share available on the entire market for any price, but I guess we will see that when that happens
I know there is no guarantee of naked shorts
Opportunities are everywhere and i don’t see opportunities in the near future that can justify the amount of risk of market crash here
Could be
And you could very well be right; I'm not really even disagreeing with your thesis at all
Yeah that’s not market risk
Never said it was market risk
The risk of sitting out is zero
Opportunity cost is tied to the concept of risk, and can be viewed through that lens
But sure
You keep reading from a dictionary but continue to prove you don’t know what you’re talking about
I guess where we differ is that you think risk can only be losing what you already have
Where’s variation separate when you need him 😂
Honestly that’s already happening and is probably a smart play
When that happens we scoop up all the discounted gems
If you want us to hold just say it
You act as if all investments flow through Hedge funds
Seems like dumb advice
Stay the course
And hold GME
I had a taxable brokerage account with wealthfront that I’ve been auto depositing to with the intention of using it for a house down payment
Yes that's true, if you're young your time horizon is long enough it won't matter
Absolutely
It's much more than 20b
Man you really have no idea how little 120b is for institutional investors
You have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about and are advising people to move all of their money around
Don’t know why you are being downvoted, this guy is a conspiracy nut and giving horrible investment advice
Thanks for the feedback
Yes it has
There's this little thing called taxes
I'm talking about retirement accounts here - which aren't taxed for trading
Puts on SPY
You have a Source about that market crash scenario I can read through
One sec I'll edit this comment to link to some DD from yesterday or day before
Sincere thanks, I’ll watch for the edit
If this tanks enough other stocks I may be able to play too
This is completely ridiculous
But what do I know, I'm just a drinking bird pecking at a keyboard and this is not financial advice
Bonds are for 🌈🐻 buy GLD or SLV if your a retard near retirement
We love you too /u/SoggyEmpenadas
NO, ISSA STONK

Times Square now loves the stock
This just keeps getting better
We need billboards saying, **"Invest in your future, invest in America, invest in GME
Buy and hold\*
You guys are legends
We did it retards
The hedge fund guys will see this while traveling at terminal velocity towards the cement
Imagine some billionaire looking at this from their penthouse after losing millions
I JUST LIKE THE STOCK
Stonkies only go upsies
It’s crazy how GameStop is now the glitch of the century 🤣
Let me start of by saying that my account is only a few days old - in fact, I only created an account when WSB temporarily went private
And, I just want to let you know I am holding on to what little I've got, praying, cheering for you all and supporting in my own way
The events that've transpired from the past few days had made me realise that now might be more important than ever for me to write this - although it has taken me a thousand edits to conjure these few simple words
WE are with you on this, though you may not see us
Good luck and god speed
PS: This is not a financial advise (it clearly isn't) and not not a financial advisor (I am clearly not)
CONGRATULATIONS
What cross streets is this on
Autists, please check that your broker doesn't lend out your shares to shorters
It's called "securities lending" and a lot of brokers have it in their TOS
Can someone with more karma create a separate post about this please
Disclosure: i hold no shares in GME ( i don't think I ever bought it) and 30 in AMC ( Money is bagged in other stocks for now

I know it's poor vs rich but this sub has me thinking it's rich vs rich reddit users
People buying billboards could also be some who cashed out 30% of their gains or something
You dont buy the billboard, you rent it and often it loops between several adverts
Hahaha found the sub banner
I don't even
This is the way
Beyond awesome
Wait for it…
Ok now I'm worried we've jump the shark lol
Hahahahaha
You sir are a credit to the cause

Top tier meme

Oh you retard
I love how absolutely retarded this subreddit is
You did it
Any billboards up for rent on Wall St
That is now my favorite thing about NY
If I had an award, I'd give it to you
Any live cams out there that we can see this
What a time to be alive

Bro, why buy a billboard when u can buy more $GME
Love you autist, you are one of the best retard
This is what real revolution looks like
I like this stonk
New protections needed for 'unsophisticated' hedge fund managers
DUDE how much did you pay for this
It’s a beautiful thing
Time square
How's that working out lol
At a loss right now but it's picking up and I still believe the squeeze will happen
GME go brrrrrrrrrrr
It was 18 bucks an hour tho
We need manpower
Ads are more worth that what the ads cost, which is why ads exist 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I'm sure it costs way less now considering their is hardly anyone in times square now
Begun, the meme wars have
Let's run WORLD WIDE ADDS TO HOLD OR BUY $GME STOCK CAUSE WE ARE AUTISTS
Next step: get together and buy a Super Bowl ad
Is it too late to make money off of this insanity if I have like, 20$ and know precisely nothing about stonks
I live 5 min walk away from Times Square imma go check it out
Can we put all our money together and buy the Houston Texans
RH has extended to 50 shares the limit to buy GME

I freakn love it when average peops buy billboards and put these kind of messages
Have you guys seen this video from Jim Cramer
Someones gonna get fiiiired
I’m loving this next level trolling going on

You guys think you’re retarded
You cant stop this train

World is so much more interesting when more people have money
I am new to all of this and I want to do my part
What should I get 
They forgot the 10k price target
Apes - Let’s crush the hedgies
I don't have money for a billboard
Let’s go $GME
Not financial advice
One of the best things I’ve seen this year so far
I think my eye is leaking
Also my referbished Xbox 1 from GameStop Finally gave up after 2+ years (+ however long the previous owner(s) owned it which sheesh could be years) So if my donkey goes brrbrr we all know where I’m getting my next one
I LIKE THE STOCK 🚀
Love everything about this 🚀
Almost brings a tear to my eye
Various sources have vastly different figures
Unless I am reading incorrectly, it looks like some hedge funds/institutions have closed their short positions since the overall short % is down
Yahoo Finance say the short interest is 37
Finviz say 41
Highshortinterest say 78
Am I comparing like for like
This is the biggest flex I’ve ever seen
We should probably invest in some nets so they can't take the easy way out
My life is complete
From italy, 10 GME stocks at 330, I hava also 1000 usd left

Let me guess
I love how, for just a moment, we can all come together in unity
No love for AMC
Some one please make a billbord that says "We can remain retarded longer then you can stay solvent"
What if we joined together and didn’t sell out until the hedge funds make a collective deal with us
I’m going to liquidate all my stocks and go all in for GME
I bought one GME stock (all can afford without the wife knowing)
NOK NOK NOK 🚀🚀🚀

Endgame is coming
Let’s bring home the bacon
Let’s make it rain bucks and dollars for us
AMC and Nokia for loooooong run
Hello APES
The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy
When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers
The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares
By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral
Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares
Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price

We can hit 100k people an hour for 18 bucks, if they share even more
Fact checker Randy
Post it on front page
Brrr is referencing the noise of a money printer
It needs to go on for about two months for the last little naked short to go up in flames
If you invest in AMC over GME you quite literally have no idea what your doing
It's the same scenario with GME
No it’s not the same as GME
Where are you finding info about the length of the shorts
This should be it's own post bro
Not got enough karma :( Could you post
Sure I'll give it a shot
Much love from Canada

Actually the Rick Ashley Post has 50k more
Oh, nicee
Wait, what
I have no idea
That's odd
Yeah it looks like it
Reddit gave subs the option to unarchive stuff (you can comment on some posts posted 3 years ago)
It looks like a lot of different subs just stopped archiving threads
Is this like a glitch or something
I believe they made archiving posts optional for subreddits
Not sure, I'm awaiting a response on r/help atm
SI is still like 9x the float lmao
I'm surprised people are here

I LIKE THIS SUB
I just want to see the face of the nyse hedge fund losers in time square to clear their mind, getting dabbed on by this billboard
Beautiful
I think this guy really likes the stock 📈
Instead of giving money to such advertisements, you should buy shares from "gme" and compensate the damage of the victims to some extent
I love this I feel like we’re Spartans getting ready to fight the Persians
This made my balls tingle
Stronggggg💪💪
Just purchased my first stock ever
Any chance AMC will soar next week
WTF 
Another way to screw the rich over is to unfollow them on social media because they get paid for there followers 
Top all time, right

Speaking of to the moon, this just reached most upvoted reddit post OF ALL TIME
If I worked on wall street
We cannot be bargained with
I hope GameStop actually figures out a way to remain viable with the boost in revenue
What if
Or, maybe they could hire game designers and produce new games
Or they could be a child-sitting service that have games for kids to play while mom and dad go shopping
Imagine if they figure it out, and the hedgies need to take out a personal loan with a co-signer just to get tendies
Brain-storm for Gamestop here to really squeeze the hedgies
Amazeballs
I'm holding my 20 shares
They have to look at this all day

I literally took this literal and blew $8700
Trolls wall street on a god level

How much are you on by
Not quite, but it's currently the 4th most upvoted post on the entire website- 8 hours after it was posted
Greed, for lack of a better word
Never too late
This is not a way to make money in my opinion
Well, it *is* the most upvoted post
I concur
No rocket 😢
If times square is in, I'm in
I WAS HERE
You mad lads are making history
What a way to flex how much we like the stock🚀🚀🚀🌕
Is AMC next 
Yo
We bow to you sir
I understand everyone may hate this comment but AMC is owned by a Chinese company who forces control and censorship on the film industry
I bought AMC almost a year ago in the 1 to 2 dollar range and promptly sold it when I found this out
Should I buy the stock if I can only afford one
For people who feel they're too late to the party with GME, or think the shares are too expensive for them, check out AMC stocks
Sweden here
Just inserting my comment on this historical post
Let's make trending in twitter to reach more people
This is awesome
On all the billboards it would be cool to stress that we should hold GME to the end
I only see „going to the moon“, „until 5k“ and so on
This is getting out of had, what a time to be alive :)
Price of $GME will boom this week
Is amc still a target as well
Hi everybody
Just keep sharing this ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA #twitter
I think its beautiful 😀👌👆
Love Green Candles
What'a move
Guys, Eastern European countries are now in the Game
We love this stock
NOW THE INMATES ARE RUNNING THE ASYLUM
Thats
Can you do one with dogcoin :-) lost 50%
Guys, I could not be more impressed by this movement
What was done last week was amazing and it caught the world's attention
So, let’s not underestimate them the same way they have done to us all this time and let’s teach them a lesson that would live forever
Let’s show them how to do it by choosing a better cause
GME is a business that helped me to go through the life challenges and they deserve to survive, but there are other businesses that their main goal is to solve world problems and they are also struggling badly
House always wins, right
Name here the ETFs or stocks that deserve to be invested and let\`s do this before its too late and we lose our chance
I'm new here
Did you buy that
I  ♥️ the STOCK
Burrrrrrrrrrr
WE LIKE THE SDONK

I am looking for a digital billboard on US 101 as close to Robinhood's Menlo Park HQ (85 Willow Rd, Menlo Park, CA 94025)
I've seen 3 post now in the last 5 minutes, spelling "losing" as "loosing"
I went into a game stop today for the first time in years
Legendary moves
Government will soon end quarantine so we can go about our lives and get “distracted” again instead of sitting at home stonking
We need one of those showing Google supporting Robinhood
Man I am rock HARD right now, fellas
Haha
GTFOOH

Most upvoted reddit post and it's about the stock market
Why’s this downvoted
Really sorry for all the innocent people with 401Ks you might be hurting like your teacher when the market crashes on them
The market has been a 0 sum game with retail traders getting hurt for 100 years
Only this time there’s a bunch of retail traders on the winning side too
APES TOGETHER STRONG
You bought it
It’s almost as if once you start making money your movement has a fighting chance
The restrictions are real
Thought I'd introduce myself
Lol what are they gonna do when they all lose billions in silver
A friend of mine stopped talking to me because she works for Edward Jones and thinks we are not doing the right thing
Lmaooo I love it
HELL YEAH GME OR DIIEEEEEEEEEE
This is a timeline I enjoy quite fondly
I love how 2021 is pulling an uno reverse 🔄 on 2020
This is the best free advertising campaign EVER
This isn’t about money anymore, it’s a movement we‘re all in
What about BB and nok
Oh it told that me too, I was really skeptic about it as well haha
Please tell me :(
Ohh ok thanks
Great
Yup, thx for pointing that out
We’re all retarded
Webull would you like an invite
Nobody who’s here was there
How much did you make
Any other stocks we should be looking at
Payback for 2000 and 2008 
Ornamental gourds are the next GME
Is it worth buying a few shares on Monday
I got fired this week
APES
TOGETHER
I’m not very old so this might be the best thing that happened in my life
Everyone Focused on GME Right now but as you noticed, many brokers allow only 1 share atm
Anyone have any AMC NOK predictions
I’m afraid of what happens when this is no longer trending
Let’s hold GME and AMC to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀
Its time for AMC 
Would you guys help a fellow investor I'm mean I'm nobody but I'd appreciate it if we could rally up behind amc a bit more
Am I too late to the party
Maybe but amc could use your patronage
I got some AMC 40 shares
Will this be the most upvoted post ever
If GME hits $1000 can we get AOC to show us her tits
NOK NOK NOK NOK
AMC monday
The law firms Williams Attorneys PLLC and Watts Guerra LLP have teamed up to bring justice to the multitude of traders who were wronged by Robinhood's halt on the purchase of multiple stocks, including but not limited to $GME and $AMC

When I see that someone with enough money to buy a billboard in NYC
AMC/GME It was amazing to watch how a group of like minded people can change the world when they work as a unit
What’s the next stock
Whats going on with the AMC stocks
What other stocks should we buy and hold 🧐
Have to be careful of the potential bulltrap when these short calls expire
Let me know when you start with BB
Please take notice of heavily shorted and manipulated Soliton $soly
Tell me this ain’t a scene out of idiocracy
These people hate us
Euro ape paying respects
STNE IS THE NEW GME , GO RRR

J P Morgan
Can hyliion get some love
Check out BAO financial
I am a gold and silver guy
No one would benefit more from a #silversqueeze than me
Don't let people parachute in and co-opt our movement
They're either hedge fund plants, fedposting or washed-up boomers and junior mining players who have been irrelevant and underwater for years
The goal is to crush the shorts and get rich
Anything other then that, we run the risk of financial ruin
We're not here in a crusade to beat the bullion banks or crush the COMEX
That's fighting the boomers' war
Like most things over the past 60 years, they were to selfish and self-absorbed to do anything about it
Don't let these ossified has-beens distract you
If they were of any use, they would have solved their own problems
We will show them how it's done
All in on $GME or nothing
After we win that one, we can circle back and consider bailing them out
Until then, don't call us, we'll call you
No distractions, no surrender
Ok fine but what about Nokia and AMC
Wouldn't be surprised if it went into the 20s
On Monday or is that it’s height
AMC follows GME so we good
Did you really just type this out and press submit
They seem really expensive right now
AMC is cheaper and in a good position
Not in a GME position
Not in a GME position
Thank you, I'll try that now
Do yourself a favor and click on the account of every last person pushing AMC
You got AMC shares
Gamestop gaming outlet
Thanks wise redditor, I am not American or European so I don't know alot about this, but I get the general idea
Likewise
I KNOW all the scumbags promoting it
I work in the gold and silver business
It's a trap
N- 14 O- 15 K- 11  = Price target $1425
I’ve got 15 shares of AMC and 16 shares of NOKIA 
Buy buy buy spce
Which other HF is shorting a stock(s)
These brokers lend out our (good people) shares of stock in companies to be used against us
Then they Buy to Cover and move on and we lose the money
In order to win somebody's got to lose
And its Legal
I give more respect to the guy who puts on the black sweatsuit, Ski mask and gloves and goes out in the middle of the night to pull a real heist
Imagine being a starving Guatemalan and living off $1 a day and seeing that Americans in their decadence have spent you and your entire village's life giving income on having this billboard up for a minute, day, week, whatever
Cvm go up 🚦✈🕟🌪
Citadel got papyrus hands

Legitimate question: I don’t invest and I own no gme
Just read Amazon might buy AMC if you don’t believe go look er up all I know is AMC is reaching a all time high come next week get ready boys 🚀🚀
I’ll be in on Monday
Why buy a billboard when you could've bought more of the stock 🤦
Anyways AMC GME NOK go burrrrrrrr
What’s the next big one 
Would you all agree everyone left in here over the weekend still holding after last weeks -40% cuz robinghood thursday just diamond hands holding or dying
Yea I think a ton of people got scared because lots of first timers have to wait on their money and sold what they had
Imagine how high the stock would go if you let us newbees in
Dammit Reddit, why wont you play video
I hate v
Are there any alternatives angles of this because this would be so easy to fake
Who owns GME
Came in a little too late to the GME party when the stock was trading really low however I’m all in on the next GME which is obviously AMC
The only
Why tho
AMC and NOK
What about nokia

Can’t wait for SLV TO HIT THE MOON
I am a gold and silver guy
No one would benefit more from a #silversqueeze than me
Don't let people parachute in and co-opt our movement
They're either hedge fund plants, fedposting or washed-up boomers and junior mining players who have been irrelevant and underwater for years
The goal is to crush the shorts and get rich
Anything other then that, we run the risk of financial ruin
We're not here in a crusade to beat the bullion banks or crush the COMEX
That's fighting the boomers' war
Like most things over the past 60 years, they were to selfish and self-absorbed to do anything about it
Don't let these ossified has-beens distract you
If they were of any use, they would have solved their own problems
We will show them how it's done
All in on $GME or nothing
After we win that one, we can circle back and consider bailing them out
Until then, don't call us, we'll call you
No distractions, no surrender
I know it’s super neat to participate in this, but be honest, buying stock in game stop won’t do anything for people who have been killed by the institution, and it certainly won’t change the game

This is what GME money looks like
Do AMC too pllllzzzz

GME is overvalued and going to crash
Same to you AH
GTFO you bot
GME is not worth more than $20 a share
What’s the next 🔥ticker

A smile knowing that somewhere out there, there's a 🌈🐻 hedge fund 5'2" shorty crying himself to sleep somewhere on earth while you're chilling in your wife's boyfriend's basement on the moon

I like 2021 so far
I love the stock
Thankfully, most people are blissfully unaware of the painfully retarded “*noun* goes brrr” meme, so they’ll probably think this has to do with Robinhood freezing purchases of that stock
Never too late

Guys i have a problem
Insanely AWESOME
If you are being denied GME in USD on your platform, try GS2C which is Game Stop on the German exchange in euros
This makes me kinda proud hahah
I really dislike fox news but Charles Payne is correct let people decide what they want and not have hedge funds or government interfere
LFG GME TO $1000 next week
Where's AMC 🚀🚀🚀🚀😭😭😭😭
Remindme bot didn’t even have time to remind me about this before it happened
Keep it up and the government will suddenly halt the ability of private citizens to purchase billboard ad space

That's a 'Retard' billboard if I ever saw one 😘
I Love WSB
The funny thing about "The Big Short" is the story being told from the guys who predicted the collapse
Brilliant
Today, I was telling someone about this people vs Hedgies war
A billboard like this is like a big middle finger
I am now more than ever persuaded: There will be BOOKS written about it
Why not buy stock instead
What does GME open @ Monday
Only been here a day or two, but the hype is infectious so got me some GME

This is epic
You people are insane

Play the bee movie on it
IT WOULD BE FUNNY
Is that way the mods were asking for people with video skills and voice actors the other day
Thats the most beautiful and retarded thing I can imagine
Wait, whaaaaat
This is amazing, happy to be part of this moment of history
Nailed it
Whenever I hear the hedge funds are in [trouble:](https://getyarn
What a waste instead of saying hold
Love this 
Holy $$$hit
I just got done catching up on The Stand
Trashcan man reminds me a lot of this sub
LMAO
What’s the difference between red and green
When is the movie coming out
Any Dutchies in here up to crowdfund a highway billboard
A week of commercials is around €2

NYC on the map 🗺💎🖐🏽
I haven't been on WSB for months
Honestly, I just like the stock
Honestly, we LOVE the stock
YOU ARE A 💎💎💎💎💎
Should I still buy amc at $13
At this rate the short squeeze will literally last a day instead of a flash hour

It took a moment for my phone to load this, so the billboard was blank except for a small green box with upward pointing line, down in the bottom left corner
Ganhar dinheiro baixando o Kwai
Are we still buying
Too bad looks like no one can see it with everyone being cleared out from Covid

Is that real
Man, and all I did was design a bumper magnet
Can someone please explain the sign to a newb
Everyone is buying AMC is that true 
I am a gold and silver guy
This said, we must Win $GME first
Don't let people parachute in and co-opt our movement
The goal is to crush the shorts and get rich
Anything other then that, we run the risk of financial ruin
We're not here in a crusade to beat the bullion banks or crush the COMEX
That's fighting the boomers' war
Like most things over the past 60 years, they were to selfish and self-absorbed to do anything about it
Don't let these ossified has-beens distract you
If they were of any use, they would have solved their own problems
We will show them how it's done
All in on $GME or nothing
After we win that one, we can circle back and consider bailing them out
Until then, don't call us, we'll call you
I love this
WHERE IS THIS 
Viva la revolution
Don’t get me wrong I’m all in on AMC
No 🚀🚀🚀 to 🌕

You are all mad
This is just amazing, you are a legend
I'm one of the newbies on this site
Melvin gotta stop downvoting you guys

No because the only ones pushing AMC are ONE karma accounts
Because the only people pushing AMC are one karma bot accounts such as yourself trying to get people away from GME
