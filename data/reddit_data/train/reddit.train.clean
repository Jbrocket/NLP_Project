Someone needs to open a GameStop across the ny stock exchange 💎🙌
Bro wtf
This is the hype we need for next week
WE LIKE THE STOCK
This is easily one of the greatest things to happen during our lives
Just when you think this sub can't be any dumber we buy Times Square billboards flexing our idiocy
Edit: Hey guys, it’s a compliment
This just gets better and better
APES TOGETHER STRONG
Does a post sow Fear, or Uncertainty, or Doubt in any way in you
Hedge Fund interns have now learned how reddit works and want to part you with your GME shares
I LIKE THE STOCK
This is not financial advice
What a legend
I don't belong here really, I am a 63 year old Grandma who knows really nothing about the market
Can't stop won't stop
Not enough 🚀
This is great
Help GME beat earnings for Q4 by buying something from GAMESTOP
WOW
I never thought a revolution could allow me to participate drinking wine in my pajamas and not get hurt by bullets and tear gas
We are human-ing SO HARD right now
LEGENDARY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
STONKS ONLY GO UP 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
We’ve gone mainstream baby
I couldnt partake in the greatness with a kid on the way
How many chicken tendies did that run you
Bought two billboards in LA
EDIT3: DIAMOND HANDS TO THE MOON WITH ROCKET EMOJIS WORKS if you buy billboards make sure to chat u/someguyindeutschland with proof to get listed in the Times Square post
You guys are INSANE - website traffic is blowing up right now so if it doesn't work, use this link: [https://portal
As a Marine , I bend the knee and thank you for your service
I think a lot of hedgefund managers and financial institutions are fuming mad
I got in 8 days ago, money is tight right now, and I YOLO’ed in with $1,000 which is a lot for me
To me, this is more than $GME
WE LIKE THE STOCK
THE REVOLUTION WILL BE ADVERTISED✋💎🚀👨‍🚀🚀🚀💎✋💎✋💎✋
Still waiting for Papa Elon Musk to label his rockets
This is great
Do you think we can get a Superbowl ad next week
Well
You have the support of the Norwegian people, stock trading platforms in Norway was overwhelmed by all the GME buys from Norwegians
The Age of Boomers is ending
You guys are building up some crazy momentum sticking it to the man
Even if we hit 4 digits, HOLD 💎👐🏼
POWER TO THE TRADERS
Incredible
Guys I am thinking of putting about $35K CAD into GME right now
Please post any donations / good will gestures to r/wallstreetgivesback
POV: you sorted comments by new to see the last comments before the lock
This post was flaired as a YOLO so it's on the YOLO list
I like the stonx and milkshakes
Tyler Durden inspires us all to this day
First rule of ape club, u dont talk about sell
Imagine having lost billions of dollars and you have to see this on your way to the unemployment office
Welp, they reopened comments and I cannot remember if I already commented on this post or not, so
I was here
Reddit Recap LESS GOOO
What does it say
FYI this actually isn't in times Square, it's a few blocks south of Central Park
Are my upvotes disappearing
HOLD
MOST UPVOTED REDDIT POST EVER
WE STILL LIKE THE STOCK 💎🙌
Costs $18 an hour
This
Might be $1800/hr and only that cheap because traffic is way down
Y’all are forgetting there’s not much happening in Times Square these days
Yeah that can’t be the price alone
Only $18/hr
Ohh how badly I want to contribute
Extremely Volatility you piece crap the markets have been volatile from day 1 of the pandemic it’s ok for the average joe to go broke but god forbid a greedy billionaire goes broke all hell breaks loose put The CEO of all those who restrict trading from short squeezes or any freaking stock in jail
Total retard here
Still here Apes
The next few episodes of south park are going to be hilarious
I live in NY, can confirm
Are we still buying $GME
Full Support from the European 🦧 buy more GME AMC tomorrow 🙌💎
Top upvoted post of the year
Man, difficult to believe that this was a simpler time
This was in my recap
Him legend
Honestly if they have to liquidate to cover the market will crash
Market rotation into $GME
It's the year 2042
I already liquidated all my mutual funds in my roth a few days ago
APES STRONG TOGETHEUR
I bought up GME with my IRA
Bought it in my HSA
Absolutely YES
The risk/reward is simply not worth it for traditional investing right now, imo
I have been debating shorting some S&P 500 as they might go down if hedge funds liquidate some holdings to pay the interest on the short positions
VXX is the way to play market volatility
Yo most upvoted post of the year 🙌🤙
I love you guys
I like the stonk, and I like how it's on the billboard
A+
Best use of money ever
Wow
This is rad
WE LIKE THE STOCK
You should do it somewhere on Park Ave/5th Ave, as that’s where ALL THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE
Bought GME at 350 and AMC at 14
Can we please kill Nestle next
Now this is coming from someone who doesnt have the means to invest in this movement
Please, only invest in what you are willing to loose
Allow those who have the means to make this work without losing their livelihood make their stand
This WILL work, but dont kill yourself in the process
If people are wondering if its too late to join GME, just tell them $320 IS ONLY THE BEGINNING
GME 🚀🚀🚀 AMC
We should all pool together to buy a 30 second super bowl commerical
Amc all the way folks
I never would have imagine a WSB post could reach top post of all time but here we are you beautiful retards
Wtf you’re the second top post on r/all
This is the second most upvoted post on all of Reddit
You’re not last anymore lol u/flapjack626
I WAS HERE

What is “Brrr”
Brr is the sound a money printing machine makes
Thank you
Check u/pidgeonlover comment history, he said it himself
This one looks like it's "off" times square (in one of the side areas, when I was living there I'd guess a couple blocks away I'd say), certainly not [one of these](https://www
Even the most expensive one (the NYE ball drop one) is only [$1-4 million a YEAR](https://www
That’s 13,000 dollars a month
Check u/pidgeonlover comment history, he said it himself
Yeah, that's true
Last I saw was that mayor and his wife dancing on New Year’s Eve while we all were on lock down
I read earlier in the pandemic that the cost of advertising in Times Square dropped significantly because there was no people there, so I think it's believable
He’s not renting the whole hour
Sure he did
Questionable comments in WSB
It's not Times Square
No idea, guy who bought it said it’s $18/hr and dirt cheap
Probably meant 1,800 or 18,000
Can barely pay a guy to spin a board in a banana costume for that price
Lmao right
From the guy who bought the billboard
I think you may be confused
Check u/PidgeonLover comment history, the guy who bought it
Yeah, I see
Check u/pidgeonlover comment history, he said it himself
We hugged the site
This reminds me of Cards Against Humanity’s infinite hole digging
Lest we forget the [Ron Paul blimp](https://reddit
And the op got 4 years of Reddit premium from the awards
Truly a Reddit moment
If all of the large banks are short even a single share, the suck will be on the order of trillions
I don't think the stock price will go to infinity, I am saying that the price at some point will be N/A
No, but if the number of shares in the pool become lower
I am not sure what would happen if there is literally *no* share available on the entire market for any price, but I guess we will see that when that happens
I know there is no guarantee of naked shorts
Opportunities are everywhere and i don’t see opportunities in the near future that can justify the amount of risk of market crash here
Could be
And you could very well be right; I'm not really even disagreeing with your thesis at all
Yeah that’s not market risk
Never said it was market risk
The risk of sitting out is zero
Opportunity cost is tied to the concept of risk, and can be viewed through that lens
But sure
You keep reading from a dictionary but continue to prove you don’t know what you’re talking about
I guess where we differ is that you think risk can only be losing what you already have
Where’s variation separate when you need him 😂
Honestly that’s already happening and is probably a smart play
When that happens we scoop up all the discounted gems
If you want us to hold just say it
You act as if all investments flow through Hedge funds
Seems like dumb advice
Stay the course
And hold GME
I had a taxable brokerage account with wealthfront that I’ve been auto depositing to with the intention of using it for a house down payment
Yes that's true, if you're young your time horizon is long enough it won't matter
Absolutely
It's much more than 20b
Man you really have no idea how little 120b is for institutional investors
You have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about and are advising people to move all of their money around
Don’t know why you are being downvoted, this guy is a conspiracy nut and giving horrible investment advice
Thanks for the feedback
Yes it has
There's this little thing called taxes
I'm talking about retirement accounts here - which aren't taxed for trading
Puts on SPY
You have a Source about that market crash scenario I can read through
One sec I'll edit this comment to link to some DD from yesterday or day before
Sincere thanks, I’ll watch for the edit
If this tanks enough other stocks I may be able to play too
This is completely ridiculous
But what do I know, I'm just a drinking bird pecking at a keyboard and this is not financial advice
Bonds are for 🌈🐻 buy GLD or SLV if your a retard near retirement
We love you too /u/SoggyEmpenadas
NO, ISSA STONK

Times Square now loves the stock
This just keeps getting better
We need billboards saying, **"Invest in your future, invest in America, invest in GME
Buy and hold\*
You guys are legends
We did it retards
The hedge fund guys will see this while traveling at terminal velocity towards the cement
Imagine some billionaire looking at this from their penthouse after losing millions
I JUST LIKE THE STOCK
Stonkies only go upsies
It’s crazy how GameStop is now the glitch of the century 🤣
Let me start of by saying that my account is only a few days old - in fact, I only created an account when WSB temporarily went private
And, I just want to let you know I am holding on to what little I've got, praying, cheering for you all and supporting in my own way
The events that've transpired from the past few days had made me realise that now might be more important than ever for me to write this - although it has taken me a thousand edits to conjure these few simple words
WE are with you on this, though you may not see us
Good luck and god speed
PS: This is not a financial advise (it clearly isn't) and not not a financial advisor (I am clearly not)
CONGRATULATIONS
What cross streets is this on
Autists, please check that your broker doesn't lend out your shares to shorters
It's called "securities lending" and a lot of brokers have it in their TOS
Can someone with more karma create a separate post about this please
Disclosure: i hold no shares in GME ( i don't think I ever bought it) and 30 in AMC ( Money is bagged in other stocks for now

I know it's poor vs rich but this sub has me thinking it's rich vs rich reddit users
People buying billboards could also be some who cashed out 30% of their gains or something
You dont buy the billboard, you rent it and often it loops between several adverts
Hahaha found the sub banner
I don't even
This is the way
Beyond awesome
Wait for it…
Ok now I'm worried we've jump the shark lol
Hahahahaha
You sir are a credit to the cause

Top tier meme

Oh you retard
I love how absolutely retarded this subreddit is
You did it
Any billboards up for rent on Wall St
That is now my favorite thing about NY
If I had an award, I'd give it to you
Any live cams out there that we can see this
What a time to be alive

Bro, why buy a billboard when u can buy more $GME
Love you autist, you are one of the best retard
This is what real revolution looks like
I like this stonk
New protections needed for 'unsophisticated' hedge fund managers
DUDE how much did you pay for this
It’s a beautiful thing
Time square
How's that working out lol
At a loss right now but it's picking up and I still believe the squeeze will happen
GME go brrrrrrrrrrr
It was 18 bucks an hour tho
We need manpower
Ads are more worth that what the ads cost, which is why ads exist 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I'm sure it costs way less now considering their is hardly anyone in times square now
Begun, the meme wars have
Let's run WORLD WIDE ADDS TO HOLD OR BUY $GME STOCK CAUSE WE ARE AUTISTS
Next step: get together and buy a Super Bowl ad
Is it too late to make money off of this insanity if I have like, 20$ and know precisely nothing about stonks
I live 5 min walk away from Times Square imma go check it out
Can we put all our money together and buy the Houston Texans
RH has extended to 50 shares the limit to buy GME

I freakn love it when average peops buy billboards and put these kind of messages
Have you guys seen this video from Jim Cramer
Someones gonna get fiiiired
I’m loving this next level trolling going on

You guys think you’re retarded
You cant stop this train

World is so much more interesting when more people have money
I am new to all of this and I want to do my part
What should I get 
They forgot the 10k price target
Apes - Let’s crush the hedgies
I don't have money for a billboard
Let’s go $GME
Not financial advice
One of the best things I’ve seen this year so far
I think my eye is leaking
Also my referbished Xbox 1 from GameStop Finally gave up after 2+ years (+ however long the previous owner(s) owned it which sheesh could be years) So if my donkey goes brrbrr we all know where I’m getting my next one
I LIKE THE STOCK 🚀
Love everything about this 🚀
Almost brings a tear to my eye
Various sources have vastly different figures
Unless I am reading incorrectly, it looks like some hedge funds/institutions have closed their short positions since the overall short % is down
Yahoo Finance say the short interest is 37
Finviz say 41
Highshortinterest say 78
Am I comparing like for like
This is the biggest flex I’ve ever seen
We should probably invest in some nets so they can't take the easy way out
My life is complete
From italy, 10 GME stocks at 330, I hava also 1000 usd left

Let me guess
I love how, for just a moment, we can all come together in unity
No love for AMC
Some one please make a billbord that says "We can remain retarded longer then you can stay solvent"
What if we joined together and didn’t sell out until the hedge funds make a collective deal with us
I’m going to liquidate all my stocks and go all in for GME
I bought one GME stock (all can afford without the wife knowing)
NOK NOK NOK 🚀🚀🚀

Endgame is coming
Let’s bring home the bacon
Let’s make it rain bucks and dollars for us
AMC and Nokia for loooooong run
Hello APES
The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy
When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers
The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares
By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral
Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares
Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price

We can hit 100k people an hour for 18 bucks, if they share even more
Fact checker Randy
Post it on front page
Brrr is referencing the noise of a money printer
It needs to go on for about two months for the last little naked short to go up in flames
If you invest in AMC over GME you quite literally have no idea what your doing
It's the same scenario with GME
No it’s not the same as GME
Where are you finding info about the length of the shorts
This should be it's own post bro
Not got enough karma :( Could you post
Sure I'll give it a shot
Much love from Canada

Actually the Rick Ashley Post has 50k more
Oh, nicee
Wait, what
I have no idea
That's odd
Yeah it looks like it
Reddit gave subs the option to unarchive stuff (you can comment on some posts posted 3 years ago)
It looks like a lot of different subs just stopped archiving threads
Is this like a glitch or something
I believe they made archiving posts optional for subreddits
Not sure, I'm awaiting a response on r/help atm
SI is still like 9x the float lmao
I'm surprised people are here

I LIKE THIS SUB
I just want to see the face of the nyse hedge fund losers in time square to clear their mind, getting dabbed on by this billboard
Beautiful
I think this guy really likes the stock 📈
Instead of giving money to such advertisements, you should buy shares from "gme" and compensate the damage of the victims to some extent
I love this I feel like we’re Spartans getting ready to fight the Persians
This made my balls tingle
Stronggggg💪💪
Just purchased my first stock ever
Any chance AMC will soar next week
WTF 
Another way to screw the rich over is to unfollow them on social media because they get paid for there followers 
Top all time, right

Speaking of to the moon, this just reached most upvoted reddit post OF ALL TIME
If I worked on wall street
We cannot be bargained with
I hope GameStop actually figures out a way to remain viable with the boost in revenue
What if
Or, maybe they could hire game designers and produce new games
Or they could be a child-sitting service that have games for kids to play while mom and dad go shopping
Imagine if they figure it out, and the hedgies need to take out a personal loan with a co-signer just to get tendies
Brain-storm for Gamestop here to really squeeze the hedgies
Amazeballs
I'm holding my 20 shares
They have to look at this all day

I literally took this literal and blew $8700
Trolls wall street on a god level

How much are you on by
Not quite, but it's currently the 4th most upvoted post on the entire website- 8 hours after it was posted
Greed, for lack of a better word
Never too late
This is not a way to make money in my opinion
Well, it *is* the most upvoted post
I concur
No rocket 😢
If times square is in, I'm in
I WAS HERE
You mad lads are making history
What a way to flex how much we like the stock🚀🚀🚀🌕
Is AMC next 
Yo
We bow to you sir
I understand everyone may hate this comment but AMC is owned by a Chinese company who forces control and censorship on the film industry
I bought AMC almost a year ago in the 1 to 2 dollar range and promptly sold it when I found this out
Should I buy the stock if I can only afford one
For people who feel they're too late to the party with GME, or think the shares are too expensive for them, check out AMC stocks
Sweden here
Just inserting my comment on this historical post
Let's make trending in twitter to reach more people
This is awesome
On all the billboards it would be cool to stress that we should hold GME to the end
I only see „going to the moon“, „until 5k“ and so on
This is getting out of had, what a time to be alive :)
Price of $GME will boom this week
Is amc still a target as well
Hi everybody
Just keep sharing this ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA #twitter
I think its beautiful 😀👌👆
Love Green Candles
What'a move
Guys, Eastern European countries are now in the Game
We love this stock
NOW THE INMATES ARE RUNNING THE ASYLUM
Thats
Can you do one with dogcoin :-) lost 50%
Guys, I could not be more impressed by this movement
What was done last week was amazing and it caught the world's attention
So, let’s not underestimate them the same way they have done to us all this time and let’s teach them a lesson that would live forever
Let’s show them how to do it by choosing a better cause
GME is a business that helped me to go through the life challenges and they deserve to survive, but there are other businesses that their main goal is to solve world problems and they are also struggling badly
House always wins, right
Name here the ETFs or stocks that deserve to be invested and let\`s do this before its too late and we lose our chance
I'm new here
Did you buy that
I  ♥️ the STOCK
Burrrrrrrrrrr
WE LIKE THE SDONK

I am looking for a digital billboard on US 101 as close to Robinhood's Menlo Park HQ (85 Willow Rd, Menlo Park, CA 94025)
I've seen 3 post now in the last 5 minutes, spelling "losing" as "loosing"
I went into a game stop today for the first time in years
Legendary moves
Government will soon end quarantine so we can go about our lives and get “distracted” again instead of sitting at home stonking
We need one of those showing Google supporting Robinhood
Man I am rock HARD right now, fellas
Haha
GTFOOH

Most upvoted reddit post and it's about the stock market
Why’s this downvoted
Really sorry for all the innocent people with 401Ks you might be hurting like your teacher when the market crashes on them
The market has been a 0 sum game with retail traders getting hurt for 100 years
Only this time there’s a bunch of retail traders on the winning side too
APES TOGETHER STRONG
You bought it
It’s almost as if once you start making money your movement has a fighting chance
The restrictions are real
Thought I'd introduce myself
Lol what are they gonna do when they all lose billions in silver
A friend of mine stopped talking to me because she works for Edward Jones and thinks we are not doing the right thing
Lmaooo I love it
HELL YEAH GME OR DIIEEEEEEEEEE
This is a timeline I enjoy quite fondly
I love how 2021 is pulling an uno reverse 🔄 on 2020
This is the best free advertising campaign EVER
This isn’t about money anymore, it’s a movement we‘re all in
What about BB and nok
Oh it told that me too, I was really skeptic about it as well haha
Please tell me :(
Ohh ok thanks
Great
Yup, thx for pointing that out
We’re all retarded
Webull would you like an invite
Nobody who’s here was there
How much did you make
Any other stocks we should be looking at
Payback for 2000 and 2008 
Ornamental gourds are the next GME
Is it worth buying a few shares on Monday
I got fired this week
APES
TOGETHER
I’m not very old so this might be the best thing that happened in my life
Everyone Focused on GME Right now but as you noticed, many brokers allow only 1 share atm
Anyone have any AMC NOK predictions
I’m afraid of what happens when this is no longer trending
Let’s hold GME and AMC to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀
Its time for AMC 
Would you guys help a fellow investor I'm mean I'm nobody but I'd appreciate it if we could rally up behind amc a bit more
Am I too late to the party
Maybe but amc could use your patronage
I got some AMC 40 shares
Will this be the most upvoted post ever
If GME hits $1000 can we get AOC to show us her tits
NOK NOK NOK NOK
AMC monday
The law firms Williams Attorneys PLLC and Watts Guerra LLP have teamed up to bring justice to the multitude of traders who were wronged by Robinhood's halt on the purchase of multiple stocks, including but not limited to $GME and $AMC

When I see that someone with enough money to buy a billboard in NYC
AMC/GME It was amazing to watch how a group of like minded people can change the world when they work as a unit
What’s the next stock
Whats going on with the AMC stocks
What other stocks should we buy and hold 🧐
Have to be careful of the potential bulltrap when these short calls expire
Let me know when you start with BB
Please take notice of heavily shorted and manipulated Soliton $soly
Tell me this ain’t a scene out of idiocracy
These people hate us
Euro ape paying respects
STNE IS THE NEW GME , GO RRR

J P Morgan
Can hyliion get some love
Check out BAO financial
I am a gold and silver guy
No one would benefit more from a #silversqueeze than me
Don't let people parachute in and co-opt our movement
They're either hedge fund plants, fedposting or washed-up boomers and junior mining players who have been irrelevant and underwater for years
The goal is to crush the shorts and get rich
Anything other then that, we run the risk of financial ruin
We're not here in a crusade to beat the bullion banks or crush the COMEX
That's fighting the boomers' war
Like most things over the past 60 years, they were to selfish and self-absorbed to do anything about it
Don't let these ossified has-beens distract you
If they were of any use, they would have solved their own problems
We will show them how it's done
All in on $GME or nothing
After we win that one, we can circle back and consider bailing them out
Until then, don't call us, we'll call you
No distractions, no surrender
Ok fine but what about Nokia and AMC
Wouldn't be surprised if it went into the 20s
On Monday or is that it’s height
AMC follows GME so we good
Did you really just type this out and press submit
They seem really expensive right now
AMC is cheaper and in a good position
Not in a GME position
Not in a GME position
Thank you, I'll try that now
Do yourself a favor and click on the account of every last person pushing AMC
You got AMC shares
Gamestop gaming outlet
Thanks wise redditor, I am not American or European so I don't know alot about this, but I get the general idea
Likewise
I KNOW all the scumbags promoting it
I work in the gold and silver business
It's a trap
N- 14 O- 15 K- 11  = Price target $1425
I’ve got 15 shares of AMC and 16 shares of NOKIA 
Buy buy buy spce
Which other HF is shorting a stock(s)
These brokers lend out our (good people) shares of stock in companies to be used against us
Then they Buy to Cover and move on and we lose the money
In order to win somebody's got to lose
And its Legal
I give more respect to the guy who puts on the black sweatsuit, Ski mask and gloves and goes out in the middle of the night to pull a real heist
Imagine being a starving Guatemalan and living off $1 a day and seeing that Americans in their decadence have spent you and your entire village's life giving income on having this billboard up for a minute, day, week, whatever
Cvm go up 🚦✈🕟🌪
Citadel got papyrus hands

Legitimate question: I don’t invest and I own no gme
Just read Amazon might buy AMC if you don’t believe go look er up all I know is AMC is reaching a all time high come next week get ready boys 🚀🚀
I’ll be in on Monday
Why buy a billboard when you could've bought more of the stock 🤦
Anyways AMC GME NOK go burrrrrrrr
What’s the next big one 
Would you all agree everyone left in here over the weekend still holding after last weeks -40% cuz robinghood thursday just diamond hands holding or dying
Yea I think a ton of people got scared because lots of first timers have to wait on their money and sold what they had
Imagine how high the stock would go if you let us newbees in
Dammit Reddit, why wont you play video
I hate v
Are there any alternatives angles of this because this would be so easy to fake
Who owns GME
Came in a little too late to the GME party when the stock was trading really low however I’m all in on the next GME which is obviously AMC
The only
Why tho
AMC and NOK
What about nokia

Can’t wait for SLV TO HIT THE MOON
I am a gold and silver guy
No one would benefit more from a #silversqueeze than me
Don't let people parachute in and co-opt our movement
They're either hedge fund plants, fedposting or washed-up boomers and junior mining players who have been irrelevant and underwater for years
The goal is to crush the shorts and get rich
Anything other then that, we run the risk of financial ruin
We're not here in a crusade to beat the bullion banks or crush the COMEX
That's fighting the boomers' war
Like most things over the past 60 years, they were to selfish and self-absorbed to do anything about it
Don't let these ossified has-beens distract you
If they were of any use, they would have solved their own problems
We will show them how it's done
All in on $GME or nothing
After we win that one, we can circle back and consider bailing them out
Until then, don't call us, we'll call you
No distractions, no surrender
I know it’s super neat to participate in this, but be honest, buying stock in game stop won’t do anything for people who have been killed by the institution, and it certainly won’t change the game

This is what GME money looks like
Do AMC too pllllzzzz

GME is overvalued and going to crash
Same to you AH
GTFO you bot
GME is not worth more than $20 a share
What’s the next 🔥ticker

A smile knowing that somewhere out there, there's a 🌈🐻 hedge fund 5'2" shorty crying himself to sleep somewhere on earth while you're chilling in your wife's boyfriend's basement on the moon

I like 2021 so far
I love the stock
Thankfully, most people are blissfully unaware of the painfully retarded “*noun* goes brrr” meme, so they’ll probably think this has to do with Robinhood freezing purchases of that stock
Never too late

Guys i have a problem
Insanely AWESOME
If you are being denied GME in USD on your platform, try GS2C which is Game Stop on the German exchange in euros
This makes me kinda proud hahah
I really dislike fox news but Charles Payne is correct let people decide what they want and not have hedge funds or government interfere
LFG GME TO $1000 next week
Where's AMC 🚀🚀🚀🚀😭😭😭😭
Remindme bot didn’t even have time to remind me about this before it happened
Keep it up and the government will suddenly halt the ability of private citizens to purchase billboard ad space

That's a 'Retard' billboard if I ever saw one 😘
I Love WSB
The funny thing about "The Big Short" is the story being told from the guys who predicted the collapse
Brilliant
Today, I was telling someone about this people vs Hedgies war
A billboard like this is like a big middle finger
I am now more than ever persuaded: There will be BOOKS written about it
Why not buy stock instead
What does GME open @ Monday
Only been here a day or two, but the hype is infectious so got me some GME

Sell a call buy a equally away from the money put with the premium and all gains a locked in and they can hold for two YEARS with 2023 LEAPS
I’m just a humble moron and this is not financial advice, I’m just curious how this might work, asking for learning purposes

Im looking to try and do the same here in Philadelphia on I-95
This is epic
You people are insane

Play the bee movie on it
IT WOULD BE FUNNY
Is that way the mods were asking for people with video skills and voice actors the other day
Thats the most beautiful and retarded thing I can imagine
Wait, whaaaaat
This is amazing, happy to be part of this moment of history
Nailed it
Whenever I hear the hedge funds are in [trouble:](https://getyarn
What a waste instead of saying hold
Love this 
Holy $$$hit
I just got done catching up on The Stand
Trashcan man reminds me a lot of this sub
LMAO
What’s the difference between red and green
When is the movie coming out
Any Dutchies in here up to crowdfund a highway billboard
A week of commercials is around €2
Can't wait to watch the Internet Hisorian video on this

We can’t be stopped
The true heroes
You all should check out blip

NYC on the map 🗺💎🖐🏽

YOU ARE A 💎💎💎💎💎
Should I still buy amc at $13
At this rate the short squeeze will literally last a day instead of a flash hour
Aren’t hedge funds now set up for a bigger play in shorting
That's one step over madlad: Derrangedfellow
Love to see it
Let’s give it
Does anyone know if it’s still there 
Wish I had money to be a part of this

It took a moment for my phone to load this, so the billboard was blank except for a small green box with upward pointing line, down in the bottom left corner
Ganhar dinheiro baixando o Kwai
Are we still buying
Too bad looks like no one can see it with everyone being cleared out from Covid

Is that real
Man, and all I did was design a bumper magnet
Can someone please explain the sign to a newb
Everyone is buying AMC is that true 
I am a gold and silver guy
This said, we must Win $GME first
Don't let people parachute in and co-opt our movement
The goal is to crush the shorts and get rich
Anything other then that, we run the risk of financial ruin
We're not here in a crusade to beat the bullion banks or crush the COMEX
That's fighting the boomers' war
Like most things over the past 60 years, they were to selfish and self-absorbed to do anything about it
Don't let these ossified has-beens distract you
If they were of any use, they would have solved their own problems
We will show them how it's done
All in on $GME or nothing
After we win that one, we can circle back and consider bailing them out
Until then, don't call us, we'll call you
I love this
WHERE IS THIS 
Viva la revolution
Don’t get me wrong I’m all in on AMC
No 🚀🚀🚀 to 🌕

It's kind of dumb to say right now that GME will go up to the moon
What a time to be alive
What is our next move
One day i will ask this stock to merry me

You are all mad
This is just amazing, you are a legend
I'm one of the newbies on this site
Melvin gotta stop downvoting you guys
That's Awsome can't wait to be on the winning team 😎
No because the only ones pushing AMC are ONE karma accounts
Because the only people pushing AMC are one karma bot accounts such as yourself trying to get people away from GME
Lol what😂 I’m just asking a question jeez

The world is changing and the old school are late to adapt
I love this community so much

Can we get a kickstart for a $BB sign
I'm recently married, out of work due to herniating a couple discs in my back, broke as fuc and in a lot of debt, and with me being out of work the past couple months my employer has lost a couple of our large accounts, and I have been informed that even when I am healthy again that my job is no longer available to me because they won't be able to pay me due to their loss of revenue
With all of that being said
No I do not have any deluded aspirations of getting rich off of my one or two shares, and I fully understand the consequences, and the high probability that I will lose it all
But some things are bigger than us as individuals

For the longest I really thought a lot of people forgot about the 2008 financial crisis which these greedy pigs created on top of that the people lose but they end up gaining so much and for that I said we need to work together with the government and tell the government no more bill out for big business or for Wall Street Only bailout should go to the people
Couldn’t you include AMC, BB & NOK

In 2021, we may not be able to change the greed and exploitation on Wall Street, and may not become billionaires, but you reminded the world to pay attention to fairness, reminded those people to know the fact that water can carry ships or sink ships, this The year will be written into the annals of history, and every participant will be a member of this shocking world history and be proud of you
This is a movement 
Wouldnt it be better to start buy gme dircetly on monday to push the stock price even more instead of waiting for a dip at 200$ of smth
Thats not a Financial Advice and just an Open Question

Hop on Fidelity
Exactly
By prohibiting users from increasing their position, Robinhood is instilling fear and subliminally encouraging investors to sell
As a soon to be former robinhooder, where else supports free trading
Edit- well I guess no one is gonna answer me
We’re getting to them
They’ve also cancelled all orders I’ve had with them from last night
I go all in
We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules "to protect" us
People are saying they can’t trade gme on Robinhood right now
THE SCUMBAGS CANCELED THE ORDER THAT I PUT IN LAST NIGHT 3 MINUTES BEFORE OPENING
I’m contacting a lawyer immediately
They will pay dearly for this
I made a list of the four people have been talking about here and none of them are "supported by robinhood at this time,"
They need to be sued
Someone please list down all the available alternative to purchase
Time to cancel robinhood for selling out
If we all HOLD
I'm calling it
The good ol boys club ends in 2021
The whole movement is a screw you statement to the market manipulators
We've broke reddit and brokerage apps, gotten support by powerful people, made it in the media, reddit and robinhood were the top trending apps
We got this
It won’t let you buy them
I’m witnessing internet history
It's no longer about making money, it's about sending a message
THIS IS MARKET MANIPULATION PURE AND SIMPLE AND HIGHLY ILLEGAL
RH, CNBC, Citadel, and Melvin Capital are all participating in market manipulation
Longtime lurker here
RIP Robinhood
THIS is market manipulation
REMEMBER, THE MORE YOU HOLD AND BUY, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THE HEDGEFUNDS TO SHORT-COVER----> PRICES EVEN HIGHER ON THE STOCK
DO NOT SELL ON THOSE BROKERS THAT DON\*T ALLOW BUYING
FINAL BOARDING CALL
NOT FINANCIAL ADVISOR, DO YOUR DD
REMEMBER, THE MORE YOU HOLD AND BUY, THE MORE DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THE HEDGEFUNDS TO SHORT-COVER----> PRICES EVEN HIGHER ON THE STOCK
DO NOT TRANSFER YOUR ACCOUNT IF MOVING TO A NEW BROKER
Obviously not financial advice
People like those stocks
What is the problem
They're gonna lose in their upcoming IPO
NOT GONNA SELL AT 1K, NOT GONNA SELL AT 10K BECAUSE CNBC/MELVIN LIED, NOT GONNA SELL UNTIL 100K
How ironic that *Robinhood* is screwing over the little guy
Couldn't robinhood and other traders blocking of stocks be argued to be a refusal to supply and against FTC regulations
Goes to show how much they stand to lose
My $ is dropping hard as hell, but at this point i’m just pissed off, i could care less what i lose, holding till this is done
It's not WSB selling
These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price
Every share they sell is borrowed
Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen
This is a repost
We like the stock
You know who hasn't blocked buying of shares
Where can I buy gme right at this moment
First I was a bit angry that the big boys have been screwing us
Robinhood literally doesn’t allow people to buy only to sell
This whole saga is highlighting how everything is stacked against the common person
AMC is at 9
According to the Verge, Google salvaged Robinhood’s one-star rating by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews
I unfortunately can’t, as I’m on robinhood
Gamers everytime
Just joined the sub
I am in AMC and now buying some GME because they deserve it
This post is now the 3rd most upvoted post in Reddit history
Feels almost nostalgic finding this post again
It's not WSB selling
These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price
Every share they sell is borrowed
Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen
This is a repost
I  have them saved and it says they no longer sell those on their platform
What is an alternative app
AMC to the moon
My 19 shares of NOK just went through
Wow RH
Time to short robinhood
Mark Cuban, Dave Portnoy, AOC, and many others have already raised concerns on Twitter against Robinhood
GME is far from over
Didn't the Melvin group publicly say they closed their position with gme
Thats it, that seals the deal, Im no longer a Robinhood trader
I heard they removed GameStop and BB
I went over to cashapp and unlike AMC GME doesn't even show up when searched
Life finds a way
When ya gotta go ya gotta go
HOLDDDDDDD
The hedge funds are terrified and calling in any dirty favors they can
If this isn't proof the entire market is just a rigged casino for a select few gamblers, then I don't know what is
They just canceled my buy this morning
I dont know why people are acting like BB, NOK and AMC are same as GME
I think many new autists here heard about short squeeze for the first time otherwise they would understand that these others tickers can still be shorted legally and have enough available float
If you are gonna buy these other meme stocks, make sure you actually see some opportunity for long term growth or you might lose everything
We can’t buy that’s the problem
Just keep holding
So Robinhood sold me shares of a stock yesterday but won't let other users purchase them today
The hid BB as well
I lost 30% cause of RH
AMC is at $9
I’m not selling it but where does it go from there
Edit
Trying to search GME on robinhood
Edit: Jumped over to Fidelity
So BB has dropped wildly by almost 40%, why hasn't Robinhood stopped from people from selling it
FIDELITY WORKING FOR AMC
I got a free share of GameStop last March when I downloaded Robinhood
It's not WSB selling
These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price
Every share they sell is borrowed
Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen
This is a repost
Guys, hold everything
Bankrupting Robinhood is the next logical step right
Just bought 700 shares in NOK
Stop a stock from trading because it's going up and billionaires are losing money
Everyone hold AMC
So what’s the next stock to buy
NOK it to the moon  🚀🌙
R/WallStreetBetsELITE is banding together to hold and buy AMC tomorrow
Anyone else moving all funds off of robinhood once possible
We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules "to protect" us
Robinhood tells me that Bitcon cannot be sold right now
Bought 5k NOK and AMC
HOLD AMC AND RELOAD NOW
Nok to the moon
Bet Robinhood had shorts against GME
THE SQUEEZE did NOT HAPPEN YET
Otherwise open an account at another brokerage, and do the same thing
Lastly, you can request all shares be transferred to another the brokerage
Seems Robinhood will be holding the line here
Forget Robinhood
Send the dogs
Thank you comrade
What
Getting citadel bribe $
WT has it, and all free
Are you talking about Wealth Simple
Ah I was looking at signing up to that one around a month ago but then I remembered I'm poor so I had nothing to trade lol
Toss that CRB in there :D
How long does it take to verify financing with wealth simple
Took 3 days for the funds to finally land after flight
Yea but NOK and AMC still available over there
Lmao ad
Literally what type of trader since 1982 doesn’t have an account with an a discount brokerage more fleshed out than Cashapp
Hold your stocks my friend and then let RobinHood rot afterwards
It will go back up just HOLD
Don't worry you'll make money
Thats the life, G
I did too, but nothing I couldn’t afford to lose
Never heard of any of them lol
I'm on Fidelity and I see no bid or asks for $AMC 
Fidelity has proven that they are for the people
I cant even get it to load
Yes it is
How do you sell and buy In another simultaneous
It's actually hilarious because Donald Trump JR and AOC are saying the same things
So what you’re saying is I should buy NOK and AMC Rn if I can
AMC BB and GME is all open on E*TRADE
GME INTO THE SUNSET BOYS
These Wall StREETards forgot that the stock market is about the individual and social buyer psychology (esp
How much of a short interest remains on $GME, $AMC, $BB
Do they realize this group is over 2x larger than when this all started
Do they realize there are institutional funds/VIPs/politicians that are sympathetic to our cause
What do we use now instead of robinhood
CEO of Robinhood about to be interviewed on CNBC in a few minutes
If they would've just taken their losses early none of this would have happened
Soo should I invest in gme now
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A FREE MARKET ECONOMY AND THE MARKETS ARE ABOUT SPONSORING COMPANIES WE LOVE
What, is it our fault they bet on $GME shutting down losing thousands of jobs and leaving gamers without a say
I swear, boomers are upset we beat the house on a market they treat as a casino
I would love you guys to spread the word that on a recent news hour, some bald beaurocrat actually came out and said, while defending holding off giving us another stimulus payment, that they're trying to look at the data related to the GME sales because "that's not what we gave them money for
Bought me 4 shares and of AMC and plan on buying some GME this weekend when I get paid
Well this aged well, unlike robinhood
Switch to ETRADE
Still holding on to $BB $AMC $NOK
But if no one can buy it how will it go up
Would it be too late to get involved in this
I had to use cash app to by a amc stock they would not let me buy more they are black balling us because we have found the flaw in the system
FOR ANYONE PISSED OFF ABOUT THIS, please screenshot / document this market manipulation by Robinhood and email evidence and contact info to [RobinhoodLawsuit69@gmail
Cash app hid GME and is blocking buy orders for AMC an NOK
Ally suspended my account access online after trading AMC and BB
I WANT TO BUY ON ROBINHOOD
I put my money into this app, let me use it
Where is the AMC love
It's not as simple as just changing platforms though
Manipulation at its finest
If this isn’t an illegal Cheat Mode for Wall Street, what is
Please investigate communications between this brokerage and the hedge funds who fund them and would likely profit off of the restricted trading of the security
Can someone explain why we should buy NOK
HOLD
There was no reason to do this other than benefitting hedge funds and the wall street establishment
It is pulling back guys, now at $196
Where do I go to buy now that robinhood is done
Where is the SEC now that legitimate, fraudulent market activity (or lack thereof) created by Robinhood has been exposed
Remember they can cancel trading for traditional stonks but not for cryptos DOGE coin to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
I feel like companies don't understand a really simple rule
Just bought two more tendies cause WETARD
Boycott , delete and sue Robinhood 🤗

How can I buy buy buy
I know many of us who trade on Robinhood will be transferring/closing out accounts with them
It's a wonderful thing to see so many people get on our side and help the effort
It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze
DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY
It's not guaranteed to
Repost credit u/OurLordOfWar

They really need to have a chat with Barbara Streisand
Can’t wait 😜
Yes
Yes
AMC rising so fast, I had to reduce the number of stocks 3 times before I could get an order in
It won’t
When I search for it on Robinhood, it doesn't show up
RH and others are blocking buys of GME but allowing sales
Good thing i just sold out of both twitter and square
Let’s go 
Let’s go 
We can try
I'm just going to hold no matter what
I will buy alot now 
Reach out to your Congress person and senators and let them know about this stock manipulation that is being pulled by Wall Street
It worse
Robinhood just cancelled my purchase of NOK
Those stocks are no longer supported by Robinhood
I bought stock yesterday and got a message on Robin Hood at 6am that I cancelled it
RH just cancelled my pre orders, these guys are tools for the establishment
What kills me is thaybis says 'you've canceled 
The Streisand Effect is about to present itself
DID YALL JUST SEE THAT GME UP TO 400 wtf
Had to switch to E-Trade, but I bought more GME
The way these boomers reacted to this has shown they still do not understand the internet
Wow, Robinhood should rename itself to Prince John
How can I buy
WTF is going on this morning
We need Mr
Beast to drop a load for us 🚀🚀🚀 I know he wants to go to the moon
BB and NOK tanked double digits, what gives
This is just the proof how the stocks are completely controlled by the big wallets
How is restricting stock purchases a legal act by these brokers

I'm using wealthsimple in Canada and works great
AMC dipping

Fidelity keeps giving me an error message every time I confirm my purchase for AMC

They also blocked American Airlines
Imagine when the billionaires ask for another chance on their losses or to settle & we say eh
WE TAKING THE POWER BACK #fightthepower
They won’t let us buy buy buy
AMC is around $10 now
I was able to get in with Fidelity
TD ameritrade still has them up
Anyone anyone found a workaround to buy these off Robin Hood
Amc @10
I only have $3k on Robinhood but I think I might wait til my options (mostly weed stocks) expire and them close it
Not only did they hide from search but AMC is completely unavailable to buy on RH now, cancelled my limit buys
This just in, if you search in the top 100 you can still find GME
I can't wait to see the Netflix Limited Series of this when it's all over
I’m using the Gatsby app to trade options for GME and AAL
WEBULL STILL ALLOWS GME PURCHASE
WealthSimple for the win
Is what Robin Hood is doing right now more obviously market manipulation than anything GME related that’s happened before
I just switched to Fidelity but now I can't make a transfer til my bank account is approved
BUY BUY BUY WERE GOING TO THE MOON BOYS ALL ABOARD THE TENDY ROCKET
Hell, cash app lets you trade
Leave reviews on App Store, force Google and Apple to remove the app from their own stores, and let their company drown
I’d
US citizens can use it
Fidelity lets you buy
You can't buy there either
HMM
You serious
Something fishy is happening and I do not like it
People
How do we know HF aren’t buying right now while we only have the option to sell
Robinhood now says “we no longer support this stock” - you’re telling me that’s not manipulation worthy of SEC violation
If we can sell but cannot buy then who is the buyer
System is corrupt
Everybody don't forget to leave an app review for Robin hood, Trading212 etc
I even got desperate and tried to buy AMC in cashapp and it wouldn't let me
AMC buy the dip
Robinhood had a 4
This is some sec /executive order stuff

Boyos
They took our parent's money, They took our money to bail themselves out and give themselves a fat bonus, now we take wallstreets money
Jokes on them if I sell another stock I'll get marked for day trading 😎
I can still get AMC and NOK through Cashapp, Just bought shares a few mins ago
After everything that has happened over the last 12 months I can not believe we aren’t in an alternate timeline
WSB trolled
As soon as I can buy GME again I’m doubling down
GME: 120 to 273
Canadian here
Imagine if we did this regularly
I'm a medical student, not in America but still will be 60k€ in debt when I'm done in two years
I have 8 shares, bought 7 at 91 and another one at 295
I hoped it might make a dent in the end, but we right now I don't even give a fick anymore, I will take my shares to my grave if it means these villains bleed
So is it smart to go into $NOK if we can
I believe this is the transition from old money to new money
Ok serious talk
If everyone buys a stock and holds it, where do new stocks come from
Bought some NOK shares yesterday
Wall Street: "It's a free market
I just started catching wind of this in the last couple weeks
They also hid BB
I see today as a discount and as soon as these cry babies let me back in to buy I will buy more GME
AM I too late to help
Together we are strong
I believe my GME stock would be worth $250,000 today had my free speech not been illegally detained by Citadel Investments (Robinhood)
If Robinhood and your exsisitng brokers aren't letting you buy stocks you want, why aren't you moving to another broker
After market closes
Storm the Citadel

Everyone saying last comment, no you are not
I was able to buy GME on webull like an hour ago

Alternate platforms may be an option as well as a back up plan🤷🏽‍♂️
The problem is, the stuff we're promoting here is rebellious

Unable to link bank to fidelity, etrade and webull
I had placed a market order for open last night and it went through
Let the people trade
RH also said you can close your holdings but not but anymore stock for me
My order for AMC was force-cancelled by Robinhood just two minutes before open
Time for a lawsuit
Dude I got in on $Nok & $AMC before, I was trying to buy more on CashApp today but I keep getting an error
BB gone too
I'm retard and dumb, what should I do
Everyone needs to start leaving negative reviews on the IOS and Android app stores

Send error complaints to Robinhood support that you’re unable to find GME on their platform
BB is hidden too
I’d also like to point out the Sundial Growers, #SNDL has been taken off the search function as well as AMC and a bunch of other stocks through robinhood
What the hell happened to the GameStop stock I bought yesterday though
Edit: they executed the order but now you can only sell
I don’t have access on robinhood what should I use instead
How is this legal
Whats the over/under on RH lifting restrictions
I was able to buy AMC on ameritrade at 705am pst today
Are people here actually going to follow through 
I'm kinda stupid and new to trading, how else do we buy if we can't through RH
AMC seems to be the only thing we can buy right now
I have steered clear of gme for my own risk tolerance but I will be leaving robinhood over this
LOL good luck with the IPO robinhood
Considering Citadel handles their order flow, it's amazing what a conflict of interest this is for them
Retards, never forget which brokers screwed us up during this
RH canceled my BB and can’t buy AMC and GME 🤬🤬🤬 can you buy them on Fidelity
Do cashapp invest in Nokia (NOK)
Robinhood has blocked the buying of GME completely
THIS AIN’T CHINA
Flood app store reviews with this
I placed orders last night, they were cancelled by Robinhood this morning
No one buying $NOK
But when a bunch of ordinary joes like us get together online and decide to buy a stock, our "illicit" activities need to be POLICED and our pick gets HALTED
Someone buy one for $420
Wait, I bought five AMC shares on Wealthsimple yesterday
Now that amount in my TFSA is steadily dropping
Edit: Now $76
Edit 3: $61
Can we throw some support towards AMC and BB on the platforms where those can still be bought and sold
Same with TD ameritrade
You know what's sad
Still a good time to buy more NOK, BB, AMC, and GME now

And BB NOK BBBY
Can we tank the reviews on the Robinhood app for not supporting us retards in our endeavors
They’re deleting reviews on the App Store wtf
On Robinhood I have been capturing Candlestick GIFS of the GME movements from the open, with their "You can only sell
They collaborated to release false news stories and promoted them on multiple platforms
They attempted to smear and besmirch the reputations of the intellectually and fiscally disabled
This was intended to cause harm by attempting to generate a panic sell-off aka Flash-crash at the open, by releasing these things after hours
When that failed, they caused harm by restricting the trades
They have organized this amongst many Media and Financial Institutions across State lines
Somebody get Rico on the line
I cant get gme or amc in UK
Go to Schwab, Fidelity, or E-Trade to get GME
I don't like this dude but upvoted for support
I am entirely, completely out of the loop, can someone please give me a rundown of what exactly is happening here
Just threw another $50 at AMC
Bought 15 stocks on NOK
The lower GME and AMC dip the more we buy
Just bought $10k  worth of AMC while it is on sale
Were you able to cancel your money transfer in the app itself
I did it on the website under Account > Banking
Apparently you can only do it on the same day you initiate, I put money in yesterday preparing for today so robinhood screwed me
That sucks that your money is stuck with RH until it clears - I guess I got lucky that I work overnight and didn't get a chance to move the money until in the middle of the night
Same, Robinhood is shooting themselves in the foot
Actually
And now I cannot even connect to fidelity
Most places will reimburse that fee
Yes, look how many people on this board aren’t able to buy, as soon as these apps work again amc Nok and bb are shooting up
We must have bought at the exact same time
Why NOK serious question cause I’ll buy if it’s a good idea
I’ll leave another every day
Blocked out in UK for AMC and GME
Democrats have already spoken out on it and is demanding a review
Link
I tried to sign up to e trade and it didn’t let me
Managed to buy $75 worth of NOK
They hid blockbuster
DO NOT FOLD PEOPLE
Meant to say 300 shares LOL
I’m so pissed I literally grabbed more money and went through fidelity
Trader 212 not talking any more new people
Bought another 20 shares on Schwab
E*TRADE is working
SoFi still works
Y’all are taking advice from faze banks
Bought AMC on Vanguard this AM looks like you still can as of 10:30AM/CT
WTF
BUY the DIPS
CashApp has hidden those stocks too
I don't think TD or Schwab has delisted the stocks from their site yet, so try those
Can buy Nok & AMC via cash app
Yup, just bought another 2 shares with all the money I have
How am I supposed to buy
Just bought some AMC
Just got this on [Public
Ally also restricting GME purchases
The Streisand Effect
What was their reason for blocking even looking at the stock price
I’m deleting RH over this
NOOOO my order got canceled and I never got in :(
Check your local financial conduct authority if you don't live in UK and do the same
PLEASE REPOST
NOK is going UP UP UP
So should I buy all those stonks
FIDELITY STILL WORKING
Get this stuff on the news
They need to be judged in the public eye
Time to make robinhood tank
Well there goes Robinhood’s integrity
I bought today, so proud of all you internet nerds gaming the system
Buying the dips in AMC
FWIW, it looks like there's no restrictions over on Etrade
Just came here to say we’ve emptied our emergency fund for this

Do the opposite of what the MSM tells you
All gold users should demand a refund of their gold fee for this month
Can still buy $NOK on fidelity
I'm fighting on the AMC front
Hey, so I’m just a chud who found this because of all the ruckus around the GameStop stock
Let's give robinhood app some 1 star rating, the legend Robinhood took side with the poor not the rich
Citadel is a hedge fund that owns Melvin Capital Management
Melvin is a $GME short seller predicted to lose BILLIONS due to the people taking the free market back
Citadel owns the app Robinhood
Citadel banned purchases of new $GME shares on RH
Market manipulation
If we can only sell, who's buying
Question from a retard
The hedge funds who need to buy those shares
Hold my stonk, we're going to the moon
Etrade is still selling AMC, NOK, and GME
From India here
Can't find AMC
Would be swell if we can actually buy
Hold and buy more $AMC and $GME
Robinhood is not available in my country
I was able to buy AMC on etrade today
I hope we get a Boiler Room 2 out of this story line
We are Anonymous
Who do we transfer our accounts to
GME and AMC
Is the app called sofi Hong Kong on the App Store
No just SoFi
Nope
Are you [certain](https://twitter
Joining you there
I was in the same spot last night
So if collectively we set sell limits to 10k there forced at that

Okay, so how about now
You guys are chicken soup for my soul
Dodge coin is the wave

The RobinHood gay bears have chosen the dark side
I believe my GME stock would be valued at $250,000 today had citadel investments (Robinhood) not illegally detained my free speech
My STASH app won’t let me buy
Just got an email from Robinhood saying they will be graciously allowing limited buys tomorrow
I aint no one with cash,do what ,and then what
I wouldn't say legitimately at all, more like illegitimately
I noticed this as well when searching for GME
Im proud of you boys
This is the 4th most upvoted reddit post of all time
Yo let's brake there ankles
They cancelled my NOK order this morning
Stellar Lumen next
Why are some people saying not to buy any AMC shares
My bank set a $50 limit on wire transfers to "protect" my account
Robinhood: we are having technical difficulties that are in no way related to the obvious relief this would give our partners
Support me with some upvotes
Buy more NOK gang, stop sell it u retards
I just bought a bit of amc and nok
Okay hear me out
What Is the next move

The guy tweeting owned a csgo gambling site that rigged odds and created fake accounts that “won” to drive more people to join
Hi, I have $885 to spend and im new to buying stocks
I placed order for them
Use me as a GME STOCK BUY BUTTON FOR MONDAY
Short-selling hedge funds have suffered a mark-to-market loss of $19
Still, short sellers mostly are holding onto their bearish positions or they are being replaced by new hedge funds willing to bet against the stock
GameStop shares that have been borrowed and sold short have declined by just about 5 million over the last week, marking an 8% dip in the short interest, according to S3
What’s happening with BB and NOK
Let’s go
Holding AMC, NOK, SNDL
Doing it because I want to and to help short squeeze
Heard some cocky bear over on Stocktwits brag about a put he has out for March 19 for $50/share
So, I am as newb and naive as possible, I’ve worked for others for forty five years, time to work for myself, is there a viable alternative to Robinhood
How is nok the 2nd most popular stock on rh lol
I'm new to this but live what you're doing and want to be a part of it
Seems like the scumbag hedge fund   companies are shorting FSR
It was in the low 20's, got a price target of $26 then crashed to 14 and has been stuck at $15 for months
Buy Fisker
APES TOGETHER STRONG
Just joined love you tough people
PS, great idea of the user that is buying life saving heart surgeries for those 2 children

RH froze me out big time
I’m done with RH freezing me out this week
I am here to join the resistance, how do I going about buying w/o RH
Where can I go to actually buy shares of GME
I can only afford 1 share of GME
But why isn't AMC going up 
Just new to this
ITS TIME TO BUY AMC
BUY AMC ALL YOU CAN
Hey, so $GME is cheap today
That’s weird I bought three of those stocks you listed
Hope GME rebounds
Now even Revolut aren't letting people buying
If they do win because of manipulation are we organizing a protest and pulling funds out of stocks
SALE SALE SALE
You guys are hero's
Robinhood buying a 5
Cash I can afford to lose
Can we make GE go up cause it's one stock I can actually afford

Yea, to "protect" us
Buy NOK NOW
Thank you very much
I’ll only invest here from now on and stay with this platform so I can work with everyone else here, working together
They won't even approve my application and don't respond
Anyone got a good one I can call
I CAN'T WAIT FOR 2021s year in review/recap in December Before New Years
Faze banks took that info, reiterated it
The RH bs just prove it
The elites dont know how to lose
Honestly they tanked, blaming it on robinhood is understandable but I think the hedge funds would’ve won this one anyway
I didn’t tho
Anyone else feel that they should not have used those terms
One of the billionaires will try to claim terrorism
It's like the guy who got arrested for saying he was about to blow the restroom up
So when can we expect robinhood to face market manipulation charges
Since this post will go down in the history books I wanna say that Noita is a really good game and it is really fun and I really want multiplayer
I'm pretty sure they did it to PLTR and BB too
I am not a American citizen
You can, but it will eventually be handled by the SEC, which will eventually go nowhere meaningful
Just wanna say I was here
I bought Nokia shares and options
Keep buying AMC
Yes apes let's buy in to nokia to the moon and vxrt
I invested in WKHS due to future technology
The whole movement is a screw you statement to the market manipulators
We've broke reddit and brokerage apps, gotten support by powerful people, made it in the media, reddit and robinhood were the top trending apps
Hold the door and don't let them win
We got this
Yea buy physical silver
I'm sorry so we are following the words of a multi millionaire who gave coke to kids he employed, now
Too bad this tweet didn’t matter at all
You were saying
This dude is a con man
BUY THE AMC DIP NOW
Robinhood might be screwed on this one
AMC is crashing and burning
Not to burst anyone's bubble, but GME is artificially inflated right now
Yeah, we know
Here’s the WSBs list to BUY
EVERYONE listen up
Power to the People
If you’re from AUS, NZ or the UK  and want to BOARD THIS ROCKET 🚀 🚀 try using the app ‘STAKE’ to trade US stocks, I’ve found it to be the easiest to setup and and fastest to transfer funds, if you use the referral code mitchelli239, you’ll get a free stock, let’s help this thing keep rising baby 🚀 🚀 🚀  pm me if you have any questions about set up
Nobody use this scammer referral code, report spam, keep WSB clean
NOK is quite low right now 
TD is stopping me from buying AMC because they say the linit price is too aggressive
Robinhood is allowing to buy $SPCE
Don’t buy anything on robinhood, you’re now supporting a sleazy company who just manipulated the market for hedge funds
Sure, we may have lost money, but this is for the bigger cause
Many generations from now, we will be the founding fathers and mothers of modern finance, and I'm glad to hold a receipt to show the future generation that WE were the reason why the capital market is in good hands
Legal means dude, this is key
Just came here to tell everyone I logged into RH and saw GME was gone
Do you think we dont know that
What trader should I go with now
Yeah DO NOT BLOW YOUR RENT OR BILL MONEY
Like ive said before HOLDING GME since Monday
Why can’t i see the upvote on the post 
I'm holding my 1
Any reason I can’t buy anymore $GME on RH
Hold BB GME AMC
I’m bleeding 🩸
Citadel is a hedge fund that owns Melvin Capital Management
Melvin is a $GME short seller predicted to lose BILLIONS due to the people taking the free market back
Citadel owns the app Robinhood
Citadel banned purchases of new $GME shares on RH
Market manipulation
How can I join the fight if I have zero understanding
The good old Streisand effect
I want to write this comment here to know, maybe 10 later, that I was here, with all these lovely people's from all around the worlds
Cheers future me

Hey everybody these hedgefunds are losing money
We have got to create a platform to discuss in private
How can I get on the new gravey train I only have if I squeeze everything I got maybe $1000 how can I get in to help me get ahead working 40 paycheck to paycheck
Life sucks but I will never give up
SLV is owned by JPMorgan who is known for silver suppression
Occidental Petroleum coming back to play it’s going to be $100 , $150 and 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀😏🚀🚀
Should read *illegitimately
Good to go on WeBull
Everyone on robinhood that has no other trading platform should flood $SPCE
Still waiting
I’m still unable to buy GME, BB, and NOK
I’m not so sure
Regardless of whether or not robinhood switches buying back on, I will be moving brokerages after the $GME play is done
Everyone here knows that GameStop is not a good stock in actuality(Though its recent growth makes it a good buy actually
That’s a pretty brain dead take
Yeah, I know
I was motivated to invest by all of this so I took my savings account I want to use to buy a house in 2 years and I bet it all on VBTLX
Put it in the S&P 500
Ya I have a lot of s&p 500 in my longer dwell accounts
Oh yeah, I did not read the 2 years part
Congrats I guess
Yesssss
It moves quickly on TD but they haven't blocked that I've seen
They are manipulating the ask price so that it's not in line with the actual stock price
Remember wire that money to them
Dont forget to wire that money to them so its quicker to get on the brokerage
Just bought another 300 shares of $NOK
This 100%

Big tech censoring

Etoro doesn't have AMC but you can get all others
After this is done, I'm leaving RobinHood for WeBull
Someone tell me how much to put where lol
You have to set limits
Just put down on NOK
Yup
A do nothing deplorable degenerate
Make sure to set limits so you can sell in time
Its a scam
You have to make that choice yourself, what people are doing here might be illegal which is why some places have halted the trade of those stocks
ITS NOT ABOUT THE MONEY ITS ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE
Oh my gourd
They definitely didn't handle communication well but to their defense, the clearinghouse needs 2 days to clear with $ set aside per trade as collateral
I’ve tried to get the word out to you Robinhooders,  check your term agreements
When I was raising hell with my broker he calmly showed me in my contract where I signed that right away
I just found this on another sub reddit and wondering if u guys think it is legit
Buying back open on RH
I am already all in on nok
So all of the stocks are crashing
Cashapp working BTW
POST THE LINK TO THE TWEET SO WE CAN LIKE AND SHARE RETARD
Hit back at Robinhood
To get the free stock option you have to invite friends, who then have to open an account, and link their bank account to Robinhood
Never invested in stocks before but have a little money put aside
Is it worth jumping on the band wagon or am I too late to the party
Guys can I still get on this 
If I invest a couple hundred will I get any reasonable returns
Use cash app my people
Please spread this word
I have decided this sub is like the MAGA of investment
Sir this is a casino
Just write, "I'm a 🌈🐻", it's faster
Yes, please ban me and increase the echo effect of this particular chamber
I’m happy they are hiding it cause what you guys are doing is Fraud
This won't end well guys
Streisand effect in work
I can’t find tootsie roll either
And blackberry
Koss is gone from search as well
Eceleb TARDS, WE RIDE
Someone less dumb please enlighten me
The Streisand effect at its finest
Cant buy search GME on Cash app either now
Accounts could always be transitioned over to other companies
I don't see gme
Oh sorry
I saw AMC but no GME
What does that even mean
Buy how exactly
We love the STREISAND EFFECT
Too bad these Faze clowns are all pussies
Fools now we can just buy the dip as soon as it opens
Puts on Robinhood

KOSS as well
I'm going to the atm right meow
I just got RH asking questions to build a profile of me before I buy stonks

Looks like I can submit a buy for nok on Interactive Brokers
I like this stock

Also Bed Bath and Beyond
BUY WHAT DUDE EVERYTHING IS BLOCKED
I put an order in last night and yave the order confirmation but nothing in portfolio
TO THE MOON TO MARS TO SATURN TO PLUTO
I have it at 5
LETS GOOOOOO
Seriously this isn't cool
Does anyone know of another app that allows partial shares
I cant find it on cashapp as well
LETS GOOOOOOO
Ayo what should I buy and where can I do that
They are doing this because they know the general public thats been joining in with you guys recently will panic and give up
Cash app works for both AMC and NOK
God it went up to 500 and now its 250-270 because a lot of brokers blocked these stocks to be able to be purchased by the users
But the dip if you can
BB is still around
I smell fear
How do I buy more if RH is blocking the stock
RH just cancelled my queued order from yesterday
HOLD BOYS WE ARE TAKING OFF
Can’t buy BB on Schwab
It’s support but support from banks isn’t the best
Moving all my money to WeBull
Suspended on webull also
There one moment, gone
HOLLLLLLDDDDD
Don't poke the diamond clawed bear 💎✊🐻✊💎
THEY CANT HOLD US LIKE WE HOLD OUR GAINS
They're still visible on stash
Robinhood is down
Bring out the pitchforks and torches
Pluto
I had an order  queued for gme and they canceled it 2 minutes before market opened
How can someone buy GME stock if it's hidden from search
Noticed this happening real time
Dude
Beast too
They better not cancel my NOK buy order
EDIT: It went through
Anyone else can’t withdraw their money from Robinhood
They removed all the meme stonks from the top movers section at 9:20am and at that point, searching through the search bar produced nothing
Unless you currently hold a stock with these companies you cant see them
HOLDHOLDHOLD
They canceled all pending orders right before open too
I JUST LOOKED
On what though
If you wanna see it on Robinhood but you don’t own shares, you have to look at the trending page
It also looks like I can not buy bb either
We can’t even buy GME on RH now, not allowed
Smooth brain here, got a bit I don't mind losing
Get your money out of there and go to Fidelity
Let's get "Nottingham" trending
E
Toro down
WHERE CAN I BUY GME
The market is halted as well $300 not moving at open
Buying more out of spite
How about BB 
Imagine being named "Robinhood" and you do this
Robinhood restricted buying the stocks only selling is available, how is this NOT manipulating
What’s the plays boys
Big boys are scared
So where else can we buy
I scheduled buys on GMC, AMC, NOK, and BB through Robinhood last night
Your account is one day old
But how do we buy if our brokers block them
ITS OFF THE ROBINHOOD MARKET NOW
Anyone who didn't see Robinhood as an incompetent second-rate broker years ago should have been paying attention
They shut down buying options on ROBINHOOD
WHALES LETS GOO
Still holding 💎👐
All of my scheduled trades at open got canceled by Robinhood
All my brokers are down
BB is banned from the hood too
So the CEO guy went to press yesterday and portrayed himself as a warrior for small investors and came back and is taking small investors for hostage
Where can I buy
We need to hold 
How do I buy from India 
Talking about GME here
Unleash the KRAKEN
Tasty works supports us
We’re scrambling to invest in Hedi Klum’s underwear line now
I like the stock
My AMC order was cancelled, they said I cancelled it, I did not
Schwab won't let me buy either
Robinhood just canceled my GME buy
BBBY is also banned
In what should I invest, im a newcomer and eager to learn
Hate when reddit won’t let you delete a comment
GUESS IM ALL IN
True, if it isn't in your watchlist, they do not show up in search
HOW CAN I BUY
Yeah wtf, my order was canceled 9 mimutes ago
RH just cancelled all my orders from yesterday for AMC, GME, and NOK
I'm never selling
I LIKE THE STOCK
Time to hit $BB then
BURN THE WHOLE THING DOWN
Robinhood cancelled my AMC and BB trades that were lined up for open at 6:27 AM
They suck
Revolut declined my buying orders on bb and gme😏
Is there a way for us to buy more GME
Even worse they are only allowing sells so they kill the stock and then force you to sell it low
They might have locked out my ability to buy more, but I'm not selling
WE LIKE THE STOCK
I’m just a retard, how do I buy without robinhood
You can only sell AMC this morning but can’t buy AMC
German Stock market won't even allow to buy/sell gme right now
EDIT: They're pretending to have "technical issues"
Oh man i wish i could buy some but russia doesn't seem to have options to do so :(
Just got more GME on Webull
If that's the case
I can't even buy anymore wtf
I JUST BOUGHT NOK NOW DO YOUR PART INTERNET
Now I wish I had pulled my money from Robinhood sooner rather than later
Banks is a scumbag, look up what happened at Barley house and faze in general
Hold hold hold
This sounds ILLEGAL
THEY'RE ONLY LETTING US SELL
Main Street vs Wall Street
This smells like The Social Network
AND, they canceled my NOK buy
Give it time and refresh
I like how td ameritrade pricing is less than yahoo financing pricing
Robinhood needs to get sued for their platform literally not being able to work for 10 minutes into the open
LOL even FAZE BANKS is with us, who would have thought
Now when FaZe Banks is the voice of reason
Thank God I bought some NOK last night
I put a $1k order in last night (I know, small) and this morning Robinhood canceled my order and now they say the stock is not supported by Robinhood
Buy when it dips and hold
Robinhood may as well stop me from selling too
I don’t have $GME the results anymore
I mean isnt THIS market manipulation
It's like a street fight
READ THE DD'S
Isn't it interesting that no one on CNBC is talking about the Gamma Squeeze
Make sure you know the Short Squeeze hasn't even begun
Another Gamma Squeeze still coming on Friday
I'm not an advisor but I LOVE this STONK
Melvin has unlimited loss potential on GME
They got themselves into an infinite loss scenario doing illegal things because they got greedy and now all we have to do to LITERALLY NAME OUR PRICE is hold shares and not sell and they are forced to give us money infinitely, government bailout and all
HOLDING UNTIL $69420
Robinhood cancelled my orders on BB and AMC placed overnight with no explanation
They cancelled all my buys
I can’t even log in today
Webull blocked this too
This is an obamanation
Why they did not restrict NAKED SHORT SELLING
They aren't letting us buy more :(
TOS can still buy 
Too bad I only have Robinhood and it will take 1-2 days before any other platform will approve my account
Hella poor so wont be gaining but at least i can enjoy some memes and billionaires stressing
IM NOT SELLING BOYS
I just tried searching for GME in RH and nothing this is absolutely crazy
These CHEATERS still can’t hold down GME
So I mean if you have options in any of these expiring tomorrow you just lost THOUSANDS
How is this legal
Thousands of dollars for ppl just wiped out, and NOT in a normal market way
Let me buy tendies robinhood
Arent they sponsored by cashapp
I noticed I bought some Naked today, and now it suddenly says not supported
No kidding I was putting $600 into GME but that got cancelled
Hell yeah
I wanted to buy stonks 🥺
Robinhood marketed themselves as the platform for "the little guy" but they sold trade info to the big guys from day one, which is legal
I have no idea what happening but I have a ton of disposable income, what do I buy to create the most havoc
My BB purchase was canceled on rh
I tried getting a little bit of AMC and NOK last night and they canceled my orders just now
How can I even buy
HOLD
Fidelity not making it easy to buy
I can't find BB either
Taking all my cash out of rh and going to webull
Streisand effect
I don't understand who's buying these options if Robinhood isn't allowing anyone to buy
Is Robinhood buying them and writing options to outside investors
Arbitrage is common for traders
EVERYONE HOLD
I have a theory, what if all these platforms are halting buying the stock because they anticipate the squeeze happening soon
DDoS attacks on free trading forums and possibly reddit over the last couple of days
Run it up
Cashapp seems to be hiding GME too, anywhere I can buy more
GME is still game
TD is struggling this morning to run again
WE LIKE THE STOCK
Democratizing the market my arse smh
Cash App has also blocked the stocks as well
They were also hiding CCL this morning
Thinking I discontinue using Robinhood because they're not letting me invest in what I want to invest in
Pricks cancled my AMC buys on me this morning
Never thought i'd agree with Banks about something like this
I ordered amc 10 hours ago and they canceled my just now
My Canadian trading platform (RBC DIRECT INVESTMENTS) has been down every morning this week
For anyone who doesn't realize by now, this is how big banks make money
BUT IT IS NOT UNBREAKABLE
Worst comes to worst, we'll form our own brokerage
WALLSTREETBETS BROKERS
BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE PEOPLE
Is there a broker that is allowing us to still buy Reddit stocks 
Was able to buy GME on Vanguard
Afford to lose
Yeah this is totally sustainable and 90% of people won't lose their money
RH canceled all my orders placed for GME last night
I bought a share last night (yeah I'm a plebe) and this am I noticed it was "not supported" but said I owned the share
Their bs manipulation premarket only lasted 10 min til gme was back positive
Also International Brokers (IB) won't allow purchasing $GME anymore
What wall street doesn't grasp yet is that these things will drive people into other monetary systems that they cannot control
They don't know yet, what they have started here
I just jumped on the crazy train
I put in my orders after hours and now I don’t have any stock in anything after they canceled all my orders and blocked the stocks
Hey folks, just downloaded webull to navigate around this cluster and it appears gme among others are suspended there too
Webull is suspending GME, AMC and Naked I cant buy
Removed the option to buy anymore too
THEY CANCELLED MY ORDERS FROM YESTERDAY
Wild I thought it was just me
Yep made an order at 4am just fine, hour before the market opened they shifted it to "not currently supported by robinhood" then cancelled my orders right when it opened
Where can I buy every platform I am on has stopped trading on all these
I would encourage everyone to document evidence of these items and submit formal complaints to Robinhood and your state and federal authorities
Oh more than hiding them, they cancelled any orders for them and said that they cant be bought and sold on robinhood anymore
Is this why I can’t add money to my Robinhood account right now
Streisand effect in live time
Jokes on them I don't have cash to lose and still buying 🤪🙃
Robbin' the hood
Gross
Robbinhood cancelled my orders for GME and AMC, wtf
I did what I could on Revolut boys
Dude
And my $USD still isn't available to withdraw they are just holding my $USD hostage
Internet is undefeated
First time posting here
Just bought 23 shares at 330
And I’m going to HOLD
Schwab is not letting GME trades take place
I don’t know the legalities around this, but it sure as hell seems criminal
Power to the people {in banes voice} robbinghood must be punished for there actions
NOKIA NOKIA
My local broker keeps cancelling my GME order
Bad move rH
Market manipulation
Fidelity is blocking all market orders on GME, AMC, and BB
That seems illegal
They’re so lucky we can’t buy right now
Zenabis
Can still buy in the Public app
STAKE is down at the moment, either deliberately or groaning under the load
How are people gonna buy now
I'm in the EU so can't trade options but decided to do my bit and buy GME stock, but Revolut has cancelled all my orders and same with others I've been chatting to
DO NOT SELL
They cancelled my purchases I made today on NOK and AMC but my other ones went through
I was able to buy stocks on ETrade and just brought AMC 5 shares but thats all I could afford today
So I'm not an investor
How can Robinhood legally do this
How do I buy when Robinhood can’t even search it
Doesn’t show up in my Stash account either
Wish I could upvote a thousand times
I just watched hundreds dissappear before me eyes to protect me from hundreds dissappearing before my eyes, as if a 29 year old man needs protection
Wells fargo you heard it here first
Buy Buy Buy
I was able to buy on Vanguard I LOVE THESE STOCKS
The future is now, old men
So if I’ve got my stock on Robinhood, do i hold
THEIR NAME IS ROBIN HOOD remember how ironic this is
I can't buy or sell SNDL either
Robinhood is fixed
So weird
How do I buy now
RH 1
I decided to try but figured I was too late for the GME train
I cant even go to the moon
Don’t you know
AMC needs to dip more so I can buy more
Buying for you ✊🏻
For the record, ETrade has been rather steady in all of this
Use Webull guys
TD Ameritrade allow GME to be Sell ONLY at $50 below market price , unless you are willing to buy at $9999 per share
They cancelled my buy in to Nokia as well
I signed up for RH lastnight to buy some GME
Seriously how do I buy now
Im impressed
Got a note that Robinhood cancelled my order and now the website is having loading issues
Good tweet tho i like the stocks 🚀🚀🚀
Stash still got it
GME BABY WE’RE IN
Where can GME be bought now
Schwab blocking due to error = symbol is not valid
Corruption
They didn't just hide it
I just bought through TD, though they were not showing today's chart, and popped up warnings about margin limits being enforced on it
I want  to buy #GME but can't anywhere
I've been a observer on the GME front, but when I saw RH restricted things this morning
When this is over I'm definitely pulling my money out of robinhood and moving to an actual brokerage
I'm downloading Webull to drop 500 bucks, just because of this blatant manipulation
PUMP SUNDIAL
If you can't buy on Robinhood that makes the stock harder to get generally, right
Robinhood won’t let me buy more GME
They actually put out a statement, they blocked about 8 stocks from being bought at all
I can’t afford to lose any, for me 50$ is the difference between rent and no rent this month 🥲 fight on for me boys
Trade republic in Germany the same
Does this mean BB isn't a buy
So glad I never bought into the Robinhood hype
Please rate robinhood app on the app store
Never comment on anything, didnt even have an account until recently but Im speaking up now
This is the way
I got all my shares canceled last night on Robin hood
But what platform can I use to buy
Don’t mind me, just here so that more people get to see this
I bought $200 GME last evening and I get an email this morning saying my order is canceled
Yep, when I search GME in RH it doesn't show up, but on Schwab it is still there
NOK to the moon
No, prices go up when there are more buyers than sellers
You're thinking of a sell restriction
Robinhood locked my positions and does not support the stick anymore
WealthSimple in Canada is just giving people a warning
How can you buy in Robinhood
WE ARE IN THE ENDGAME 🙌💎🚀🚀🚀🚀
I only have $1400 more I can contribute but I'm in
Yo I’m losing hope in WSB If this the case
WTF
TD IS BACK ONLINE IN CANADA, IT IS ALLOWING YOU TO PURCHASE
Robinhood won’t let me buy more of the stonks
From the UK, can I help
They just canceled my limit sell at $10000
How does a 🐒 like me get in, all the online traders are blocking the stock and/or new traders
Literally can't buy they canceled my orders
They blocked purchases for $CTRM
My Charles Schwab account is doing the same for GME
So flood Robin Hood with calls and negative reviews for this blatant market manipulation
When you fight the internet, the internet wins
Also they hid bbby and in the last 30 seconds removed the option to buy
AMC IS FALLING GME IS UP
I'm just trying to look at the price man
How am I supposed to buy in if they’re getting banned everywhere
Has RobinHood given a statement on this yet
WTF, even my Ally financial is showing that its down
I do love how this whole thing is now involving everyone from politicians on both sides to esports gamers
Can RH block our limit sells in the 1k, 2k upward range
Robinhood cancelled my order for both AMC and GME
FIDELITY too
They (Robinhood) are canceling my orders from yesterday
Fidelity works
Is there anywhere we can buy
GME to Uranus
Use WeBull to buy more GME guys
This is gonna backfire hard 
ALL IN ON NOK
Wish I could afford to help in this fight
I started a switch to webull after robinhood pulled its shennanigans
I wanted to hop on Robinhood and help the cause by throwing all my disposable cash into GME and now I can't even search it
Thank you for that sweet sweet dip 🤚🧻
I can't buy
What’s the play today
They completely removed BlackBerry as well
Switch to Webull or join the $SLV gang (not blocked on RH)
More like robbin’ the hood, amirite
Woohoo
LET’S GO GME GANG WE CAN DO THIS
Oh these are the market forces I’ve heard so much of
Yup, I had an AMC purchase already scheduled for this morning
I'll buy in at $420
Is $AAL in play :) it’s going up
Where can we still buy gme shares
Thank God I was just able to buy 4 more GME shares on ThinkOrSwim
Move to Webull
Storm Wall Street
I am NEVER dealing with robinhood again
I'm on the same boat
Let's gooooooooo
I hope they get demolished
Streisand Effect
Robinhood app suddenly won't allow screenshots to be taken
So we can’t open options great
Since the market opened Ally is hiding my accounts
I'm locked out of both RH and etrade rn
Since RH and ToS restricted trading, what are you guys buying through
I just bought NOK and my td account all of a sudden stopped working for log in on my cell phone
BB not mentioned, that means buuuuuy
Robin hood canceled my order
After this, y’all need to take your money out of Robinhood
Don't forget SNDL
Did I invest in the wrong AMC stock then
Butthole clenching watching NOK
TD Ameritrade and Fidelity open account pages are legit crashing - can't even get through to open a trading account
Ok so I bought 4 shares of AMC last night on Robinhood, and this morning it said I cancelled my order which I didn't cancel at all
Stash blocked users out of their accounts
Real talk, RH canceled my orders, is there another brokerage app that I can open and start buying
Not to mention the ameritrade froze on opening this morning
Etrade still working I bough nok and bb today with my spare money
Blocking certain stocks from being traded is definitely market manipulation
My RH order of AMC from 2 days ago was just canceled
Next thing you know, they’ll come after this subreddit and shut it down
I'm a small, small fish, but even guppies can get sent into space as an experiment
I sent a sell order on my 1
But now that order is still stuck in pending and apparently I'm locked out of buying NOK
All I'm taking away is that $BBBY is still up
Are we still holding on AMC tho
Ameritrade I can’t even log in on
Placed an AMC order last night, got canceled this morning and now says AMC is no longer supported on Robinhood
TAKE ME TOOOOO THE MOOON
Where can we buy IN THE U
K
I'm having the same problem with Ally
Robinhood blocked purchases of GME just now
When I’m looking at rh app it says that I canceled the orders
No one forget what RobinHood did
Why are purchases not being allowed
Schwab looks like it’s working
Hold da line
Can I use e-trade to buy amc and GameStop
It's time to leave Robinhood
SPCE
When you are in Canada and use Wealthsimple so it’s not hidden
They literally cancelled my buy I made at 4am
I got 28 shares of AMC, trying hard to get the cash for more, i want to ride to the moon with you all 
Anyone know what happens to my Nokia shares now
Done
Only bet left is to buy BB at an exponential rate - BUY AND HOLD boys
What's the move
Fossil isn't blocked on Robinhood
Where can I buy if not on robinhood
Had moved in $100 last night waiting for the open this morning
Where can I buy stock in AMC and GME since Robinhood hid them
Speechless that this is OK
I'm sorry if this is a retarded question, but why is anyone saying "only play with what you can afford to lose" if there is theoretically no way for the retail investor to lose in this instance
What broker should I switch to
Robinhood no longer supports GME
Is fidelity still letting you buy
Left 1* review for the pos app and heading elsewhere
I was able to put an order through on Weibo
This legitimately seems like something you could sue Robinhood before the SEC for
This is whack
I woke up to cancelled orders for GME and AMC
Thrillin morning hoping that Wealthsimple didn’t do the same
Yeah wtf my NOK is hitting a hard ceiling
They literally just tried putting the fire out with gasoline
Took all of my shares, sold them and bought 1300 dollars of GME, this better work or I will cry
Any suggestions for a different app
I CANCELLED MY LIMIT ORDER FOR $400
I searched it last night and placed an order to buy for this morning
TIL - Robinhood app is nothing like the real Robinhood
Seeing AMC stock go down now, is this why
Go to Public
How can I buy in gme rn if I can’t BUY GME RN
Can this be finally the moment both the left and right unite against the establishment and find common ground
So as an unexperienced trader, I put in for shares yesterday after market close and now Robinhood is allowing closing transactions only; what's the end result going to be
They’re going to cancel, they canceled mine like 5 mins ago
BUY AS MUCH GME - BB - AMC as you can and show them they don't own us
RBC in canada is literally DOWN this morning
What do I use
Its now sell only, they have just ended themselves as we now know who they are for
Streissand effect
Schwab has hidden cost basis for these tickers on my account
I’d love to buy but I can’t
Anyone that uses robinhood should continue to use it, right up to the week before their IPO and then cash out and jump ship
It sure doesn’t seem like it should be legal to disallow purchasing of a publicly traded company
I can’t even find BlackBerry
Sucks that I can't buy with Nordnet
I’m canceling my Robinhood account :)
I can get GME and AMC on E*Trade just fine
Retards vs Evil
I've been lurking for a long time and I wanna jump in the rocket while I still can
Good to know, thanks
Ride the waves baby 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

INTERESTED IN PUMPING ALT COINS
The fat cats of wall street are fanning the flames of their own house fires, they could have just let the garbage can burn itself out and it would have been an acceptable loss, but instead they poured oil on it
Lets send $AAL to the moon
Leave reviews on App Store, force Google and Apple to remove the app from their own stores, and let their company drown
Someone explain to me why they're doing this in simple words
I can still trade on Vanguard

Robinhood cancelled my order for NOK at 9:27 and the message says I cancelled it,  but I didn’t
It’s gonna be occupy Wall Street 2
All in BB AMC NOK
This guy legit went on video yesterday talking about empowerment and the opportunities his platform provides
E trade users rise up
WeBull is having a gateway error when you try to transfer accounts now
Vanguard is allowing
I'm 20% down on NOK, but I'm presuming you autists are gonna make it moon right
I can't even get on my broker account to support the cause
Now that is market manipulation
Ah well
WEBULL on the App Store
Why do you people not use something like Futu
Interactive Brokers won't allow buying options on GME, AMC, and a few others
I'm not aware of any issues with E-Trade where I have another account, but I like keeping two brokers because of crap like this (usually margin changes on a particular security)
Amc network is available on robinhood BUY BUY BUY
Schwab has GME listed as invalid
Remove those 420
Schwab says symbol is invaild
Chase just executed my buy order
Stash too I have 3 out of 5 just pending when Disney and Tesla went straight to my account
On a normal day, I wouldn't consider exercising my call
So crazy
Why do we care about Faze Banks
It seems all the shorted stocks are restricted in Robinhoob right now
Sorry to say the US is no longer a free country
Puts on Robinhood
Tell me what to buy on Robin Hood
TD Ameritrade is pretty nice, makes me feel like cool hacks man
If anyone absolutely wants to buy GME(any meme stock since it seems like BB and AM-ç are suspended too) I can work out something through PayPal or zelle
I think based off my account history you'll be able to determine I'm not a scam
Reatard AMC rocket emoji to the moon
I get mine through Hargreaves Lansdowne, my purchase of NOK has been pending for the last 30mins
Where can I go to buy more GME
United we hold, divided we sell
They canceled my orders from NOK and BB last night
Is it still worth it to buy
WSB mods, please make a new forum , INVITE only with people who have made any posts since before last few weeks AND who have karma
So frustrated and tired of being manipulated
Anyone else have their $AMC orders cancelled and in the messages it says "You've canceled your order to buy X of AMC" when you didn't cancel it yourself
GME AT NEW HIGH
I just tried to log in and got error messages
YES, we need you now more than ever
Are significant gains still realistic at this point
If people buy and hold, yes
Nokia
Lmfao my son wants in now good job
They are even restricting me from YOLOing more money on SNDL
I can only see my CTRM on portfolio page
Don't give up on GME
This is an ant's life playing out in real life
I offload apps to save space
They are shorting all of the stocks that were popular on WSB this week
Ameritrade still allowing GME/NOK/BB/AMC purchases (if you can log in) BUY BOYS
I'm waiting for my money to transfer to E-Trade
I wonder if Robinhood could be brought to court over this
My bank posted a message this morning on their trading page essentially saying "The price we're showing you isn't what your trade is going to execute at
GME SOLDIERS SALUTE
They just restricted $SNDL
Honest question, this will probably be buried
If you already have GME shares or options on Robinhood, can you trade
Did Robinhood liquidate those positions to cash
Wow now it says that GME is not supported by Robin Hood
Honest question, this will probably be buried
So how do we find it on Robinhood now
Doesn’t seem communist *or* free to me
Any other tools I can use to grab some today if I don't already have an account elsewhere besides cashapp
How is this legal
THEYRE TRYING TO MAKE US FOLD
FINISH HIM
If you delete RH you can’t sell
Yay streisand effect
I can't buy GME anywhere but I'm in on NOK and AMC

I am clueless about the specifics on trading and only have a 401k, but I'm going to work toward learning now
Bought what little I could of AMC last night and woke up to it being cancelled
This definitely caused a considerable dip
Where can I buy GME
My order has been cancelled for reasons I’m uncertain of
Where we going next boys
Webull turned off comments
As someone who is new to stocks, where and how do I start
I threw $2000 in $AMC
I fully support this effort but I can't say it enough, stop using Robinhood; the app is letting a few other institutional funds see the transactions and front run them
Never bought with you bros before
I don't see why they wouldn't understand that preventing us from buying stocks we love would piss us off
They are there, but are “no longer supported on robinhood
They removed it from their app
On Cash
Was anyone else anticipating this
Can't even log into the Robinhood website to close my account
I wonder if I should buy in this FOMO hype
What should I buy
Can’t buy from Robinhood, WeBull, and CashApp anyone else 
You can still buy NOK on Cash App
Asia supporting the cause i got 3 shares at 264 on IG CFD at open
Can everyone PLEASE hold their AMC
It's like they've never heard of the Streisand effect
SPACE THE FINAL FRONTIER
BB's rise wasn't even insane, it was a good rise for a stock and they still blocked it
LET’S GO BABY
I don’t own any GME but the blatant corruption is just disrespectful
Anyone else having issues with webull
Is anybody having trouble buying on TD Ameritrade 
Blackberry not on the list
Switch over to Webull
Banks is filthy rich id like to take his money too
No problems on Webull
Use Webull if you have it
Etrade won’t let us create accounts
I logged into my Fidelity account just to see if I had a little money to play with and hardly anything is functional
I just bought AMCX is that not the same thing
Yahoo just saidbshares of GME plunged cuz of this
Guess what
Just use a real service like TD Ameritrade
Sundial just blocked
All of the money I could afford to spend is currently locked in Robinhood
Why is my E*TRADE ticker not keeping up
This makes me smile 
Can I set up a same day account anywhere just to piss in their cheerios
RH won’t let me buy BB
WeBull too
How do I buy more
Euro poor reporting for duty
Just bought 1 GME and 19 AMC we will make them hurt the same way they made us hurt
Total war
This is freaking market manipulation
Get into SNDL
No worries though
I have E*trade and I’m running that, but I have a little on Robinhood I wanted to play with
That’s also blocked
It soon will be
HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
I so wish I had more money to throw a gme
If FaZe Banks is saying to purchase something like this, do it
Anyway around this ban to find those stocks
Can't buy bb either
I put in a purchase order last night so that at the beginning of day I could buy some and it would not let me it says I can only sell my current shares
I can't even fund my Robinhood account, it errors out everytime I try to buy
What should I buy
Robinhood canceled my order to buy another share and now it says you cannot purchase more shares of this stock
Wanted to buy back into game today, now I can't, why are exchanges blocking buying gme stock
Buy NOK & AMC
Got my order canceled through Robinhood and tried cashapp and they won't go through
But market manipulation
File a complaint [sec complaint](https://www
Put in orders for gme and amc last night on rh
Can't stop, won't stop, GameStop
I like the stock
Is Schwab on record limiting buying
Yeah I tried to buy another $300 of GME last night and this morning they said I cancelled the order
This whole narrative of hiding stocks for "your own good" is patronizing and infuriating
SNDL is off robinhood now also
You can still buy through Stash app even though they will show a disclaimer that you are buying a volatile stock prior to purchase
They cancelled three of my orders, no explanation
SoFi still works
Where can I buy GME
Buy it somewhere else
Imagine what the internet can do to these platforms if everyone on WSB collectively closes their accounts on the same day
My NOK rocket got stranded in Texas
I can't even create an account with Robinhood
BB🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Buy what though
Why can’t redditors get a gf but they can crash the stock market
THEY ARE MANIPULATING THE MARKET
To show support for you weirdos I bought some amc and Nok- not enough to make a difference
Tried buying nok and game on open but robinhood cancelled then both and I can only sell my amc now
How else are y'all buying now
EDIT: Public has now also stopped buying of $GME (and $AMC)
Robinhood cancelled my orders wtf robinhood
Let's jump on BB 
You can buy on Merrill Lynch and Vanguard
Koss is gone too
What is a good place to buy from
Stash is “updating” or “experiencing a bug” haha
Last night i had a dream i was piloting a rocket ship, hurtling through space towards the GME share price
Around me was fire, in the distance a red stock counter which was rapidly counting upwards 1000, 2000, 3000
I tired to buy a share of AMC and they canceled it
EXPRESS gone as well
Bought some of these stocks last night and after open it still took an hour for my orders to be filled
My wife asked hpws my "stunks" doing today
What other broker has instant deposit so I can delete RH
I’m moving all of my $$ off Robinhood into less-corrupt brokerages
I guess it’s time to give Chinese Webull another chance
How do I buy if Robinhood won’t let me see it
I put in an order last night and it was canceled and I can no longer buy through RH
They are hiding EXPR now too
Pretty sure cashapp is hiding gme too
Switching to Fidelity
Yeah they straight up made gamestop unavailable on robinhood
Lets goooooooo
We the people
AMC is at a temporary dip, BUY MORE WHERE YOU CAN AND HOLD, DON’T PANIC SELL
Got some here in the states on Webull
I'd like to thank all of the boomers for their lack of pattern recognition and their extreme arrogance for fueling this rocket for us <3
The belong in Prison
Wtf, RH just dropped Sundial Growers too
Just bought on Merrill Lynch
ROBINHOOD CANCELLED MY ORDER THAT I PLACED LAST NIGHT AND SAID THAT I CANCELLED IT
What’s a good alternative to Robinhood
Problem they won’t let just buy robinhood and E*TRADE is now down
Bought one share of NOK , it was all I could afford
So much for the free market
Is
Yo, i put in a buy market order for 15 shares at open
This is it
Stand your ground brothers
Wow hiding it from search is next level sh\*t
You know who isnt limiting searches
Got into AMC, let's gooooo
I placed an order last night and it was cancelled this morning
They blocked buying on trading 212 for gme and amc
This is unreasonable
Thanks
Won’t let me buy any more
There’s a notification that says “this stock is not supported by Robinhood” for NOK, GME and AMD
Forget search, I can't even buy in a new position on GME with Robinhood
I loaded Fidelity on Android/ iOS apps, mobile browsers, 2 laptops and circle jerked my way around them until they allowed a BUY
Then rinsed, repeated
They tried to shut me out of NOK AMC GME
Holding
NOBODY SELL WE’RE TAKING THIS TO PLANET 11
I wonder if cancel culture can touch the %1
What's the best mobile trading platform
From Canada
This is not financial advice
This will only further disrupt them - organized chaos
I didn't want any but now that I cannot get any
Hold steady 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Tried to by aftermarket of AMC, they cancelled ny order
I'm new to this someone tell me a service to go through other than robin hood to buy
Every single time they attack retail retail just gets more ballsy and the stock soars
How dumb can Robinhood be
The SEC MUST going after Robinhood
Can you use a VPN to change your location and use different trading app
I will certainly not be using RH after this
The fact that they are able to do that is nuts
BB still safe
Where else can I buy GME
RAGE MY BROTHERS RAGE
I have 50k burning a hole in my pocket and know nothing about stocks except for all the hype I've been reading
WHERE can I buy some more at
They took down SNDL about 15 mins ago
Robinhood won't let you buy stocks in BB, NOK, GME, or AMC because they're, all of a sudden, "Not Supported"
Is this even legal
So as a complete amateur who's only ever used Robinhood, where could I get AMC stock now
I am willing to EMPTY my robinhood account into a new broker now
I’ve never messed with stocks in the past
STREISAND EFFECT IN FULL EFFECT
For those with time and motivation, and hopefully the more eloquent among us
Also, contact your senate reps
You can get NOK and BBBY on cash app
Go on etrade and buy 50k of GME lol
I wish I could buy more
I'm leaving Robinhood as soon as this is all over
I had nokia in my list and they suddenly show "this stock is not supported on robinhood"
Nevermind, I regret it all
So as someone new to this 
If I can’t buy on Robinhood
THIS IS WAR
GAMESTONK 🚀🚀🚀
As someone new here and someone who doesn't understand what is going on
Head on over to TD Ameritrade
Had to try like hell to get a buy in on Schwab this morning for AMC
So then they blatantly took the stocks, WHICH WE LIKE, off of the platform
Td has also halted trading on all the tickers being discussed here
I put down money for a share at 292 and they take it off the market lmao
I’m not very market savvy but this sounds like they’re trying to strong arm companies into blocking average folks from buying in which seems like a roundabout way of admitting that it’s not a fair market at all
It seems more apps are slowing their apps so people won’t buy
They removed $BB 😭😭😭
Puts on Robinhood 💀
I'm genuinely curious about something
Rocket tax: 🚀🚀🚀🚀
They stopped trading so you cannot see them
I can’t even sign up for robinhood :(
If anyone making the trades would like to benefit a dog needing surgery soon
God i was lonely trading for 3 years like a casual retard and I discover you guys when the boat has already sailed

Click Here to file a complaint wit with FINRA
Click Here to file a complaint with Robinhood directly
We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules "to protect" us
I think BB also block on there
They also did this with Tootsie Roll (TR)
Use etoro, etoro lets you buy
I purchased $4k worth of shares before RH could lock me out
Be Angry Be focused

Also AAL KOSS
Soon as that $100 gets in my stockpile acc I’m goin IN
Why is amc down :(
Etoro is also working
Hoped to buy the dip this morning before the 🚀 takes back off
I'm on Robinhood and it won't let me buy
Even BB has been hidden
In a Trump Administration this would be investigated by Congress & the SEC but in a Resident Asterisk admin, they'll never pay for this
Hold boys
Wells fargo is here next
I just noticed you can no longer purchase you can only sell GME and AMC
Just tried to buy addl and robinbood blocked, only available for sale, not purchase
WTF mate
They cancelled some of my overnight buys without reason and others still are on delay with no explaination
Robinhood says it does not support AMC now
Ally invest also shut down trading
We all need to join together and file a lawsuit against these brokers
The Streisand effect card has been played
So glad I bought into naked like a month ago because line went down and it was cheap
I cant even get on Td
I put my AMC order in last night
CAN I STILL BUY DECORATIVE GOURD FUTURES
It says 1
ROBINHOOD
Cant find in Robinhood
Say it with me: Bears r fuk
I’ve tried to invest in AMC and GME twice in the past 2 days using robins hood and my orders have been cancelled twice
Wow, Robinhood sold out to the Sheriff of Nottingham
Wow they “banned” GME
Oh wait
CHARLES SCHWAB DID THE SAME THING
ROBINHOOD CANCELED MY ORDER AT 8:26
My GME and AMC orders were canceled on Robinhood and now they don't show in a search
Also hid CTRM
Don't forget BB
Leave reviews on App Store, force Google and Apple to remove the app from their own stores, and let their company drown
You lucky duck
Let's go in OCGN, it is set up for next fight already
I will never sell, I will never surrender
They just cancelled my order this morning that I placed yesterday afternoon
Boycott Robinhood
Is it too late to jump on the wagon if I've never invested in stocks
Welp, robinhood just lost a customer
Schwab is also freezing all GME, AMC, buy and sell orders 💎🙌
I just have a measly 1
European retard here
If you can afford to, NEVER SELL
They refunded the $100 I funnelled into AMC and cancelled my stock order
They are blocking reviews on the App Store by the way
With people like FaZe Banks commenting on the matter this is going to be more and more public every minute
You can't even purchase $SNDL, which isn't even a part of this movement
Just confirming I opened a Fidelity account, set up a transfer and was able to buy GME and AMC
And now we short the hedge funds
I don't even know where to buy :(
Nvstr, Dough, Firstrade, Webull, Public, and SoFi
I sold 2k of ira on fidelity but they won't let me use to put into gamestop
We need to get Faze Banks a new avatar, yo

Leave a review of your experience
FaZe Banks is giving sound financial advice, and we thought 2020 was wild
Move your accounts from RH to some other platform
So many people are setting themselves up for an SEC investigation and they don't even realize it lmao
What's up with PRTY
Can anyone find $KOSS on their search bar in Robinhood
Send a direct message to robinhood by asking for "help"
What are some good alternatives
No you cannot
Forgot to mention, all you need to do is open an account with other brokers and tell them you want to move from RH and provide details
Webull just suspended gme wtf
Will hold until the sun dies out
I’m on Stockpile and it’s still visible
I’ve never done stocks
BUY GME, HOLD
Just bought £500 GME in my SIPP

Doesn't sound very Robinhood-like to me
I say we make them reconsider this
Bombardier is next
Even Charles Schwab was like that
Doubled my position in NOK today - I welcome the dip
It’s available on e-trade
Luckily TradeStation let me buy today
BOUGHT 1 SHARE ON A CASH ACCOUNT NO BORROWING AGAINST ME BOYS
How can i join this marvelous movement
To the mooooooon
Citadel Capital handles 60% of Robinhoods trades
Hold your position and request to transfer your stock to WEBULL or somewhere else, even TD Trade is better at this point
Funny how you can’t buy, but they let people sell
With all these distractions, BB is falling
Never thought I'd actually agree with anything Friar Banks says
Hell really has frozen over
I bought at open
If you go to most common traded stocks you can still find all of the ones we’re trading
Should I join you
Honestly - here's my philosophy
Should I join
Are yiu guys gonna be mad at me if I sell 40stocks at 500
Public mobile app has been working for me this morning, was able to add to both GME and AMC with no issues

Can I flip a quick buck from this
Fidelity finally let me through @ $417
To the moon
Trading 212 suspended buying for AMC this morning and only allowed selling
My parents lost our house in 2010

BB getting the spurs put to me but still holding
I'm holding to the moon meet you all there to chill comrades  🚀🚀🚀
I wan't to take this opportunity to thank every single person in this community
Wow Robin Hood cancelled my order for GME
How have none of these people heard of the Streisand Effect
I think people are selling to transfer funds over
I’m trying to but I accidentally sold my Robin Hood share and it wouldn’t let me cancel and Now I can’t make an account on any trading site
Bought 1 share at 369
Make sure retail investors can only sell
HOLD THE LINE
Cat is out of the bag
Alright alright alright, which apps are allowing trades with GME or the others
Webull isnt allowing ya to buy AMC or GME at that moment
No, we buy more at a discount
Was banned from Robinhood due to day trading while poor anyways during all this
Etoro has everything up 
If you missed your chance on GME, here's the train coming back around
Where should we buy it now since they removed it
How can I buy GME if Robinhood blocked it
I successfully bought GME this morning on Vanguard
My RH order for NOK and AMC just went through, but KOSS did not
I still hate Robinhood, but I placed a buy order for 2 shares of GME after market had closed yesterday and they fulfilled my order 15 minutes ago
Will monday be too late to buy in
FAZE CLAN

Mine just processed, did a quick test run
AAL gone now too
What trading app should I use now fellow soldiers 
Is this the official sub
Yeah I can't view or trade $GME
Have issues signing for Schwab 
This is error message I’m getting
They did the same to SNDL and CTRM
Hello folks, I created this page  r/takedownrobinhood to take this topic collectively serious at some point once we are in less volatile times to make sure that the Robinhood and other platforms pay for taking such outrageous and illegal actions against us
Just threw $1K at GME and AMC through Fidelity
Bb and amc too
You can still buy GME on Wealthsimple, dont know if this helps
GME BB AMC ARE BEING SHORTED YOU DROP YOU LOSE
So has Charles Schwab turned off transfers
On Etoro they keep closing the market and it keeps "glitching" and looking like it has tanked 70 percent but in actuality it's cruising upwards
Up in Canada wealth simple trade isn't
Robinhood won't let me buy more blackberry shares but will let me sell them
Any recommendations for apps to get into trading then
Robin hood is protecting the king
E*TRADE is now crashed
I buy on Stash for long term
Sndl
I created an account on RH and dropped in all my disposable income to buy GME this morning and now they won't let me
Transfered money to my trading account now but the money won't arrive before NYSE closes until tomorrow
No
E Trade has a error when I try to create an account
Cashapp illegally blocked GME but you can still do NOK and AMC
Your good bro I bought last night and they cancelled my order this morning so at the very worst you should get your money back
I know but I want to get in on this madness
So getting on tomorrow will probably be fine
Yes
I switched to Fidelity now so I can continue to buy stocks from AMC and GME
Shirts are winning on NOK
What if long holders exercised all their deep in the money calls
Pretty ironic of Robinhood - considering the story of Robinhood and all
I can only buy  minimum of 1 share through my broker, wich is to pricey for me
Koss and tootsie roll they stopped as well
Koss and tootsie roll they stopped as well
Makes me wish we could old school have someone on the floor representing us and tossing papers around screaming like in the movies
FIDELITY GUYS
Guess no one's buying $SNDL either
Transfer your shares to somewhere else
Holding on for dear life
Cash app NOK purchase has been pending all day
Was able to buy GME and AMC through Etrade account just now
CASH APP IS CANCELING ORDERS BUY SOMEWHERE ELSE
Robinhood blocked purchases of these stock also
Bought another share,total of 9 now because they pissed me off
Tried switching to Fidelity and transferring funds 
BB got hidden too
What else do the shorts have to throw at this
How do we buy if they hid it
Is it possible to get more people involved in this like global
Love Fidelity
Ameritrade webpage is hanging if you are trying to open a new account, I'm in the UK can you recommend a platform still trading GME anyone
Where can I move my money to from RH, where this kind of BS won't happen again
I guarantee this douche isn’t investing all the cash he can afford to lose
WE WILL BE DINING ON THE MOON SOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌝🌝🌝🌝🌚🌚🌝🌝🌝🌽🌽🌽🌽🧇🥓🧇🥩🥩🍔🍔🍖🍖🍗🍖🍟🍕🍟🍕🫓🥙
Get a different broker if they banned it
Melvin can fondle my balls
I put some of my meager monies in at $417
I bought a few Nokia shares last night only to wake up to see they refunded me it and now I can't buy it on robinhood anymore
Should have stopped using Robin hood a long time ago
I'm proud of all of you
Fidelity is the way to do it y'all
So I just bought some shares of AMC off cash app
IBKR IS GOOD 
Trading of GME, BB and others gets halted frequently, or sell-only
Got an order on limit in through Vanguard - I’m officially part of wsb
The dip
They also hid BB
I haven’t participated in this at all, but I just want to say you guys are doing great work
CashApp won't let me look up $GME either
ON SALE RIGHT NOW
Buy XRT, their fate is bound together
BB got hidden as well
Robinhood is also blocking $SNDL
Robinhood uses Citadel, so RH is a victim too
Tbh banks is not someone I would want on my side
Did robinhood freeze for anyone else
Don’t buy anything other than GME
GME or bust people , we must hold
This is completely illegal and constitutes market manipulation
Just picked up NOK on cashapp
I keep buying on DeGiro 🚀🚀🚀 even AMC
Faze banks is an idiot but his message is sound
NOK BABBBBBEEEE TO THE MOON
Cash App did that with GME
Same for black berry
What other platform can I use to buy
How are they allowing selling and no buying
I don't really like faze banks, I honestly think he's kinda a douche
Charles Scwabb is working, too
Can't even search Game stop now
I would if Robinhood hadn’t been holding up my cash infusion for days
Buy GME ONLY
They hid BB too
I think the SEC is in on it to try and decrease volatility and stop the frenzy
Fill out SEC complaints
We can’t buy, only sell, but yet they say a public Reddit thread is one guilty of manipulation
The unstoppable power of We The People on display, hit em hard where it hurts
Dont sell your RH position yet that is exactly what they want
This isn’t the first time Robinhood has manipulated the market
How long does it take for funds from your bank to be transfered to your Robin hood account
What other apps can I use
This too shall crash

R they gonna restrict them forever
It's ok, NOK tanked already
Yes this is the way

Very malicious
Robinhood canceled my order for 1 stock of GME, what do I do about that
What we do now 
Not TD here in Canada, been trying all morning
You will never be able to win against your owners using their tools
It’s open on stash
Upvote so it's not in the comments
How long will this block from Robin hood go on
Are you trying to buy shares on Fidelity and running into an error message
This is not financial advice, just technical internet help in case you have already decided to buy the stock for some weird reason
S
All they are doing is postponing their demise
Congrats for reaching r/all/top/ (of the day, top 25) with your post
About to buy 300 worth of amc
I didn't find any posts that meet the matching requirements for r/wallstreetbets
It might be OC, it might not
Feedback

HOLD THE LINE
Cash app is doing the same thing with GME
Well
If you're not buying fractional shares vanguard is still allowing you to buy in
But we can’t
Use [TDA](https://www
Someone needs to meme the Thanos meme with the RH logo
What about trading212 they blocked buying GME and AMC today morning in Europe
Ally Invest is down
Same with Cashapp
Stupid question

The establishment just tried to put out a fire with gasoline
Use revolut to buy stonks  (šo far the havent blocked GME, AMC
Just submitted to withdraw all my funds from Robbinghood
I can’t even search for little old XSPA
Supporting from Australia
They hid blockbuster also
They also cancelled my order from last night

So to recap the last 24 hours
All i know is they are scared of us

Am i too late to join this 🚀
Ok they cheated, but is it over
Heres what I wrote the SEC on my complaint against robinhood
This is Occupy^2
Of course not
This is Occupy^2

They now hid american airlines too what the heck is this
Only one working for me is vanguard right now
STREISAND EFFECT BABY
Is there anywhere that shows the short interest in realtime
GME is not on Schwab search anymore
Fidelity not allowing purchases
Im on jumped on fidelity even after losing money cause of robinhood stock manipulation
I'm so blown away at what's happening
No, use the app
EDIT - But they blocked trading on certain stocks
SoFi App is still running smooth
Vanguard works fine for me
SoFi is currently working for me
Banks a legit Clout God
Well
Ironic for a service called "Robin Hood"
Is it too late
Father Banks always representing
Father Banks always representing
ROBINHOOD = CITIDEL = KEN GRIFFIN
It's going back up boys
Really, this is the guy you want on your team
Where do I buy
The question is, is it too late to buy
Can anyone tell how to invest in the GME
Most stock sites have been hiding them since yesterday
Has anyone contacted their representatives
Because buying was impinged price was suppressed
Hop on WeBull 
Webull says they're stopping buying as well now, though they filled my limit buys at 145 on the way down earlier
Let Robin Hood know you’re pissed
Glad I already had 200 shares of Nokia
Ally invest halted trading on AMC
Revolut is literally doing the opposite lmao, the first 3 stocks it shows you are GME AMC and BB lmao
Can't buy anymore NOK either, not just GME or AMC
I hope the affected companies file a complaint as well
Retard here
Hey I know this thing, it's called the strisand effect
I'm new to investing
And they say banks isn't on our side
You can scroll the news ticker and find mention of GME and open from there
I can't even *find* GameStop on Robinhood anymore
I have been planning to switch to Robin Hood for over 2 years now
They can only control us because we use their currency
Etrade is working
I wish I could buy some and watch it go down so I'll just cheer you guys on from the sidelines
Anyone know if this is happening on Schwab too
Infuriating
First thing I did today is moved toward ditching Robinhood
Low kEY FACE BANKS IS A BTICH,
Anyone using Revolut
Where do you go to buy these stocks 
These cocksuclers need to take their lumps like big boy
How does this little idiot join in on this
I bought $50 in NOK on CashApp
How can I buy
It ain't much, but just bought 2 shares
What should I buy
They also stopped Sundial too
Love u banks
I want to know how many shares are shorted now
I can't wait to buy pluto with all this gme money
TradeRepublic also blocked buying, you can only sell now
So what brokerage apps are you guys using besides Webull that are not blocking trading or hiding companies from search
Well done if you bought the dip on GME today and doubled your money
They also hid Sundial (SNDL)
I don't have much money, I can probably afford 1 share, will it be worth it
Any advise for those late to the game that want to participate in sending $GME and $AMC TO THE MOON
What's the next move
How do I buy this now
If you can get in
Man this is just getting better and better
Don’t forget CTRM
For someone who is completely illiterate in the stock market but has $100 to invest can anyone give an ELI5 instructions
I was stoked to buy Robinhood stock when they IPOd
Was using a blocking statement I have never seen before, it was different from their standard one
Retard here
So did Cash app
Webull did the same thing
Can’t find BB on there anymore either
TDL please
This is amazing I've never really been interested in Wallstreet bets but honestly this is just hillarious to watch
Don’t forget $BB
We die on this hill⚔️
Salute our Indian brothers
Just bought AMC on Fidelity
Just bought some on etrade
Let’s buy RYCEY
All theyve done is made people aware of stocks that are being mooned
AMC bb and gme all open on E*TRADE
STASH app did the same exact thing
This a new one
This a new one
I'm a complete utter noob when it comes to stocks
Where to buy
AMCeeeerrr
Finally starting 2021 and the people are winning
It’s no coincidence that Dan Sundheim is a major investor in Robinhood and is his firm is *also* losing big on GME
Barbrastrisand
Yeah Faze Banks woukdnt be the rep I would want to put on the front page, he is the type who will say this but dump while everyone else holds to make a quick buck off of you
Can't even watch the stock realtime but you could about 2hrs ago
UK here - IG Trading Platform is working and $BB, $AMC, $NOK and $GME were all trading fine - just checked and $BB, $AMC, $NOK all able to "buy" but "sell" is grayed out
Ally
Search manipulation we need to hold the line boys
Where can I buy
Etrade
What if Robinhood was waiting for this moment, like This is the reason the app exists in the first place, just a security net for the hedgefunds that own it
There’s a guy who posted on this sub about a lawsuit against Robinhood
Remember they can cancel trading for traditional stonks but not for cryptos DOGE coin to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
What stock we jumpin on next
GME shows up now
Rh is tied to a billionaire capital firm that was losing money like all the rest of them and shut it down
The GME stock "is not supported on Robinhood" as of my checking just now
That's if you can even find it through the search function
You madlads and your rocket ship have so many people rooting for you
YES
It’s Alex Cabeceiras
I cant load the wsb subreddit, did someone take it down

The Streisand effect
Here to be a part of history
I don't have any single penny to spare, but my thoughts and prayers are with you, retards
I’m upvoting with my multiple accounts
And once you are able to, transfer all your shares to fidelity and close your RobinHood account
Does anyone know how to go about changing over all my positions from robinhood
Dude even him
You realize you’re making Blackrock rich, right
All of this has got me interested in becoming an investor
I can’t even upvote these posts
I'm just so proud of you all
Where to go to buy
Maybe-  but it’s going to make all other upset from this year
FWIW [Ally
Bread time
Can someone explain this pls
Stock market has always been a rich person thing that I didn't understand and never really cared about
This is not the first recent incident that should make you question if Robinhood is the right platform for you to use
If someone could explain to a very poor person that would love to stick it to the bigger corporations for once in their life, I’d love any advice/help
Seriously, as soon as I can buy I'm doubling what I planned on putting down
More or less correct
But why ban people from buying AAL too
Why invest in something the government doesn’t mind bailing out time and time again
As soon as they stop manipulating the market I am buying more
Ah man I guess we can only sell
So did E-Trade Power for a time
This is not the first, nor the last
So how can I jump on this train
Cash app allows buying NOK
How do i help with my $1000 and never traded before
Added 12 more
Little question I'm hoping someone see's and answers
How did Reddit know the hedge funds were shortselling GME stock
Isn't all trading secret
New to this, but really interested
Please all hold and keep this going
Wow glad faze clan is telling you guys how to gamble your money
As a primarily app based company they love app ratings
S
Take me to the moon Elon 🚀🚀
Can someone ELI5 wtf is going on with this entire situation
Hedge funds use more aggressive tactics like this to make a ton of money and it hurts the industry
So these madlads on WSB decides to buy A LOT of gamestop's stock, a company expected to fare very poorly
You can still buy AMC on Cashapp
Is AMC gonna be just as lucrative as GME though once this pans out
Can’t see the anger from the stock price at this moment
Can someone ELI5 why I should or should not buy my first stonk and make it GME
Doesn't sound very legitimate
I can not even buy the GME dip because tdameritrade haven't clear the funds from another position that I sold yesterday
It would just increase search volume for those stocks in particular with people asking why it isn't there lol wtf type strategy is that
I think something similar happened in 2008 if Melvin was the hedge funds or institutions
Im a brilliantly autistic retard and bought in via revolut 
Oh my god this is amazing

Sort of correct but to invest into a Hedge fund you need to be a millionaire so it's more like millions of millionaires use there collective wealth to then leverage against retards and autistics and rape/fix the market as they see fit
Brilliant people of this subreddit

HE'S IN I'M IN 💎✋ WILL WIN
You dont know how much meaning and hope your post gives us in this hard time of crime and injustice
Every army needs a king
IF HES IN , YOU'RE IN, I'M IN, EVERYBODY'S IN
Just bought 140 shares this evening
Why should only big money decide who gets to live and who goes down under
If it weren't for Tesla and the people who believed in it, when all the big hedge funds were trying for years to put it down under, who knows where we would've been today in EV tech and industry
GME, for better or worse, is waking people up to the realization that we, as individuals, still possess the same power as we always have: the power to unite, collaborate and structure ourselves around ideas in order to bring them to reality
People are starting to realize that not only can they affect change in their societies by the power of their vote, but they can also do it by the power of their wallet, regardless of its weight
Wealth inequality needs to be tackled at all levels of society, not just by policy
GME is a good company, with a solid investment thesis and more importantly, the potential to transition into something that our generation of gamers sorely needs
Save and transform
I'm sending a message, as I know you all are
Remember, change is a long game of attrition which will be won only by those who will endure its tides
I am not selling
Man I really needed to see this after today
HE DIDNT SELL A SINGLE SHARE
Edit : forgot you apes can’t read : 🚀🚀🚀🚀
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN

OUR KING HASNT SOLD
Didn’t sell a single thing today
IF HE's IN I'M IN
I doubt any of you will see this with 8000+ comments in this thread in under an hour but I just wanted to say I'm rooting for all of you
He's in, I'm in
TAKE MY ENERGY GOKU

Ben Shapiro on his show trying to baselessly claim that the redditors who started this already cut and run

You beautiful diamond handed person

BY THE POWER OF GREYSKULL
OK ALL IS WELL
HES STILL IN
This man lost 14 million today, and reacts with nothing other than an update
I'm sure DFV knew it wouldn't all be green days
Losing more money in a single day than most people here will make in a lifetime
In 3 lifetimes I couldn't make what you lost today
SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE  Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME
Such an inspiration, not even joking
They’ll own homes, pay off student loans, medical bills, set up college funds, and be able to relax
My only regret is jumping in so late
I pray when all this is said and done, your lineage never has to work again
HE LIVES
WE ARE NOT LEAVING
HE’S STILL IN I’M STILL IN
HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
Ouch
My gf is mad/sad that we're in the negative after opening at almost 50% gain today
IF THEY CAN REMOVE THE BUY BUTTON, WHATS STOPPING THEM FROM REMOVING THE SELL BUTTON WHEN THE PRICE IS SKY HIGH
LEGENDARY STATUS UNLOCKED
DFV could have taken the $47 million yesterday and sold out to the sweet high life that the elites enjoy in secrecy with their hedge funds
But No
HE STILL IM
Ok should I be putting up 15k at 196
Im so proud of you (not finacial advice)
God bless this man
I'm proud to be a part of this revolution you accidentally started
HE'S STILL IN
IF HE'S STILL IN, I'M STILL IN
This Guy's Name is gonna be in my kid's history books

NOTE: IF YOU'RE IN GME, DON'T SELL FRIDAY UNLESS THE SHORT PERCENTAGE DROPS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW 100%
So sad that even if you sell at 1000 you are going to be pennyless after you pay property tax on your huge balls

Won't even be mad when he sells
Watching a man become a legend in real time has been the highlight of my week
Yesterday I said I'd take my last 1k and buy pre-market
None of those other stocks give me the same feelings that GameStop does
NGL I was kinda freaking out today when it got close to 100
This should be the top comment
Why be angry when bigger gains await him
Oh no problem, they'll get it back big time tomorrow
The publicity this is gaining due to their dirty tricks today isn't helping them
And next week as well
Nah, he’s good
Dang dude I’m sad you aren’t in gme
This is the low tide before the Tsunami brother, this is the banks getting scared

Thank you sincerely
I can’t believe I am here for this
I love the internet when this type of stuff happens
I bought a tenth of a share the other day at 350 because that's all I could afford and I like the stock
I tried to buy @ 220 today
HE HAS SPOKEN
God amongst men
We like the stock 🙂
I wasn't in before
I'm getting in tomorrow
I was thinking of putting my entire retirement account in this and this was the post I needed for conviction
He stood in front of 40+ million and stayed in
The balls

He who is wealthy in spirit, in heart, and in friends is already rich
You’re wonderful, I watched your videos and feel blessed that someone so deserving in the world would receive those returns
I got $53K waiting on them to pull the dirty tricks after hours and try to push down the stock again to $112 
Alone we are week like a single twig
You crazy tards actually held
I held today and was down like 85k
And then here you go, holding through an almost 15mil loss
You don't just have  💎🤚's
But is he holding tomorrow

THEYRE NOT GETTING MY THREE SHARES
I put every cent to my name into this, sold other stocks I had, charged things on my credit card to have just enough money to have 7 measley shares total now
The balls of steel on this man are a national treasure
You're our last hope against the machines
God, is that you
IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN
IF HE IS STILL IN - I'M STILL IN 
Bought at $410  but I'm not selling

THE SHOW GOES ON

I dropped another 3k right before close, why
Tomorrow let's hit 10K
I was up 50k for the first time, saw it fall down to 20k
Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic
I wish I understood this more when it got started
You are pretty much the leader of the revolution at this point
If you are holding , I am holding to the very end of times 💎🙌🏻
WE RIDE AT DAWN

Aftermarket up by 63% and rising

If they don't think we are going to 10k they are in for a surprise, take it all
Is $14
What a legend, we sell when he sells
That's what it's all about
He sacrificed 30+ million of his portfolio in the name of HOLDING
Is it still wise to buy any tomorrow at open
This feels like a new Independence Day
DFV, you will soon be the reason my whole life changes
You are a good person, and if I ever get to meet you I’d be honored to shake your hand and buy you a drink
IF DFV IS IN
I'm going to be honest, I jumped in to make a quick buck because the short squeeze seemed well reasoned

So for someone who doesn’t know much besides the rabbit hole studying I’ve been doing all day, does it make sense to buy a AMC stock if I wanna just be apart to see what happens
I will be buried with my Gamestop stock and will be so rich in hell I'll be able to buy my way into heaven
I saw this
Take it as a sign
It's not to late, ya'll gotta hold and buy more and I gotta start buying and holding
